- Yarn or NPM
- NodeJS version 10+
- A Mongo Database

## Quickstart with create-payload-app

To quickly scaffold a new Payload app in the fastest way possible, you can use [create-payload-app](https://npmjs.com/package/create-payload-app). To do so, run the following command:

```
npx create-payload-app
```

Then just follow the prompts! You can choose between a TypeScript project, which is fully supported by Payload, or a JavaScript project. You'll get set up with a new folder and a functioning Payload app inside.

## From scratch

Adding Payload to either a new or existing app is super straightforward. To add to an existing Node + Express app, just run `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps payload`. Or, to start a new project from scratch, run `npm init` and then `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps payload express`.

From there, the first step is writing a baseline config. Create a new `payload.config.js` in the root of your project. The simplest config contains the following:

```js
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';

export default buildConfig({
  // By default, Payload will boot up normally
  // and you will be provided with a base `User` collection.
  // But, here is where you define how you'd like Payload to work!
});
```

Write the above code into your newly created config file. This baseline config will automatically provide you with a default `User` collection. For more information about users and authentication, including how to provide your own user config, jump to the [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config) section.

Although this is just the bare minimum config, there are *many* more options that you can control here. To reference the full config and all of its options, [click here](/docs/configuration/overview).

### Server

Now that you've got a baseline Payload config, it's time to initialize Payload. It requires an Express server that you provide, so if you're not familiar with how to set up a baseline Express server, please read up on exactly what Express is and why to use it. Express' own [Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) is a good place to start. Otherwise, follow along below for how to build your own Express server to use with Payload.

1. Run `npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps express` if you have not done so already
1. Create a new `server.js` file in the root folder of your app
1. Add the following code to `server.js`:

```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.listen(3000, async () => {
	console.log('Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.')
});
```

This server doesn't do anything just yet. But, after you have this in place, we can initialize Payload via its `init()` method, which accepts a small set of arguments to tell it how to operate. For a full list of `init` arguments, please consult the [main configuration](/docs/configuration/overview#init) docs.

To initialize Payload, update your `server.js` file to reflect the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const payload = require('payload');

const app = express();

payload.init({
  secret: 'SECRET_KEY',
  mongoURL: 'mongodb://localhost/payload',
  express: app,
})

app.listen(3000, async () => {
	console.log('Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.')
});

```

Here is a list of all properties available to pass through `payload.init`:

##### `express`

**Required**. This is your Express app as shown above. Payload will tie into your existing `app` and scope all of its functionalities to sub-routers. By default, Payload will add an `/admin` router and an `/api` router, but you can customize these paths.

##### `secret`

**Required**. This is a secure string that will be used to authenticate with Payload. It can be random but should be at least 14 characters and be very difficult to guess. Often, it's smart to store this value in an `env` and set different values for each of your environments (local, stage, prod, etc). The `dotenv` package is very handy and works well alongside of Payload.

##### `mongoURL`

**Required**. This is a fully qualified MongoDB connection string that points to your Mongo database. If you don't have Mongo installed locally, you can [follow these steps for Mac OSX](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) and [these steps](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) for Windows 10. If you want to use a local database and you know you have MongoDB installed locally, a typical connection string will look like this:

`mongodb://localhost/payload`

In contrast to running Mongo locally, a popular option is to sign up for a free [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), which is a fully hosted and cloud-based installation of Mongo that you don't need to ever worry about.

##### `mongoOptions`

Customize Mongo connection options. Payload will connect to your MongoDB database using default options which you can override and extend to include all the [options](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) available to mongoose.

##### `license`

Your Payload license key. Not needed for development purposes, but when it's time to deploy to production, you need to add your license key here. More info about how Payload licensing works can be found [here](/docs/production/licensing).

##### `email`

An object used to configure SMTP. [Read more](/docs/email/overview).

##### `local`

A boolean that when set to `true` tells Payload to start in local-only mode which will bypass setting up API routes. When set to `true`, `express` is not required. This is useful when running scripts that need to use Payload's [local-api](/docs/local-api/overview).

##### `loggerOptions`

Specify options for the built-in Pino logger that Payload uses for internal logging. See [Pino Docs](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=options) for more info on what is available.

##### `onInit`

A function that is called immediately following startup that receives the Payload instance as it's only argument.

### Test it out

After you've gotten this far, it's time to boot up Payload. At the command line, run `npm install` and then `node server.js` in your application's folder to start up your app and initialize Payload.

After it starts, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to create your first Payload user!
