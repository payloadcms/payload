## Software Requirements

Payload requires the following software:

- Any JavaScript package manager (pnpm, npm, or yarn - pnpm is preferred)
- Node.js version 20.9.0+
- Any [compatible database](/docs/database/overview) (MongoDB, Postgres or SQLite)

<Banner type="warning">
  **Important:** Before proceeding any further, please ensure that you have the
  above requirements met.
</Banner>

## Quickstart with create-payload-app

To quickly scaffold a new Payload app in the fastest way possible, you can use [create-payload-app](https://npmjs.com/package/create-payload-app). To do so, run the following command:

```
npx create-payload-app
```

Then just follow the prompts! You'll get set up with a new folder and a functioning Payload app inside. You can then start [configuring your application](../configuration/overview).

## Adding to an existing app

Adding Payload to an existing Next.js app is super straightforward. You can either run the `npx create-payload-app` command inside your Next.js project's folder, or manually install Payload by following the steps below.

If you don't have a Next.js app already, but you still want to start a project from a blank Next.js app, you can create a new Next.js app using `npx create-next-app` - and then just follow the steps below to install Payload.

<Banner type="info">
  **Note:** Next.js version 15 or higher is required for Payload.
</Banner>

#### 1. Install the relevant packages

First, you'll want to add the required Payload packages to your project and can do so by running the command below:

```bash
pnpm i payload @payloadcms/next @payloadcms/richtext-lexical sharp graphql
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note:** Swap out `pnpm` for your package manager. If you are using npm, you
  might need to install using legacy peer deps: `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`.
</Banner>

Next, install a [Database Adapter](/docs/database/overview). Payload requires a Database Adapter to establish a database connection. Payload works with all types of databases, but the most common are MongoDB and Postgres.

To install a Database Adapter, you can run **one** of the following commands:

- To install the [MongoDB Adapter](../database/mongodb), run:

  ```bash
  pnpm i @payloadcms/db-mongodb
  ```

- To install the [Postgres Adapter](../database/postgres), run:
  ```bash
  pnpm i @payloadcms/db-postgres
  ```

- To install the [SQLite Adapter](../database/sqlite), run:
  ```bash
  pnpm i @payloadcms/db-sqlite
  ```

<Banner type="success">
  **Note:** New [Database Adapters](/docs/database/overview) are becoming
  available every day. Check the docs for the most up-to-date list of what's
  available.

#### 2. Copy Payload files into your Next.js app folder

Payload installs directly in your Next.js `/app` folder, and you'll need to place some files into that folder for Payload to run. You can copy these files from the [Blank Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/blank/src/app/(payload)) on GitHub. Once you have the required Payload files in place in your `/app` folder, you should have something like this:

```plaintext
app/
├─ (payload)/
├── // Payload files
├─ (my-app)/
├── // Your app files
```

_For an exact reference of the `(payload)` directory, see [Project Structure](../admin/overview#project-structure)._

<Banner type="warning">
  You may need to copy all of your existing frontend files, including your
  existing root layout, into its own newly created [Route
  Group](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups),
  i.e. `(my-app)`.
</Banner>

The files that Payload needs to have in your `/app` folder do not regenerate, and will never change. Once you slot them in, you never have to revisit them. They are not meant to be edited and simply import Payload dependencies from `@payloadcms/next` for the REST / GraphQL API and Admin Panel.

You can name the `(my-app)` folder anything you want. The name does not matter and will just be used to clarify your directory structure for yourself. Common names might be `(frontend)`, `(app)`, or similar. [More details](../admin/overview).

#### 3. Add the Payload Plugin to your Next.js config

Payload has a Next.js plugin that it uses to ensure compatibility with some of the packages Payload relies on, like `mongodb` or `drizzle-kit`.

To add the Payload Plugin, use `withPayload` in your `next.config.js`:

```js
import { withPayload } from '@payloadcms/next/withPayload'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Your Next.js config here
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: false,
  },
}

// Make sure you wrap your `nextConfig`
// with the `withPayload` plugin
export default withPayload(nextConfig) // highlight-line
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Important:** Payload is a fully ESM project, and that means the
  `withPayload` function is an ECMAScript module.
</Banner>

To import the Payload Plugin, you need to make sure your `next.config` file is set up to use ESM.

You can do this in one of two ways:

1. Set your own project to use ESM, by adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file
2. Give your Next.js config the `.mjs` file extension

In either case, all `require`s and `export`s in your `next.config` file will need to be converted to `import` / `export` if they are not set up that way already.

#### 4. Create a Payload Config and add it to your TypeScript config

Finally, you need to create a [Payload Config](../configuration/overview). Generally the Payload Config is located at the root of your repository, or next to your `/app` folder, and is named `payload.config.ts`.

Here's what Payload needs at a bare minimum:

```ts
import sharp from 'sharp'
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // If you'd like to use Rich Text, pass your editor here
  editor: lexicalEditor(),

  // Define and configure your collections in this array
  collections: [],

  // Your Payload secret - should be a complex and secure string, unguessable
  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET || '',
  // Whichever Database Adapter you're using should go here
  // Mongoose is shown as an example, but you can also use Postgres
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI || '',
  }),
  // If you want to resize images, crop, set focal point, etc.
  // make sure to install it and pass it to the config.
  // This is optional - if you don't need to do these things,
  // you don't need it!
  sharp,
})
```

Although this is just the bare minimum config, there are _many_ more options that you can control here. To reference the full config and all of its options, [click here](/docs/configuration/overview).

Once you have a Payload Config, update your `tsconfig` to include a `path` that points to it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@payload-config": ["./payload.config.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Fire it up!

After you've reached this point, it's time to boot up Payload. Start your project in your application's folder to get going. By default, the Next.js dev script is `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev` if using npm).

After it starts, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to create your first Payload user!
