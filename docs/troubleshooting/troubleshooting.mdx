## Common Issues

### "Unauthorized, you must be logged in to make this request" when attempting to log in

This means that your auth cookie is not being set or accepted correctly upon logging in. To resolve check the following settings in your Payload Config:

- CORS - If you are using the '*', try to explicitly only allow certain domains instead including the one you have specified.
- CSRF - Do you have this set? if so, make sure your domain is whitelisted within the csrf domains. If not, probably not the issue, but probably can't hurt to whitelist it anyway.
- Cookie settings. If these are completely undefined, then that's fine. but if you have cookie domain set, or anything similar, make sure you don't have the domain misconfigured

This error likely means that the auth cookie that Payload sets after logging in successfully is being rejected because of misconfiguration.

To further investigate the issue:

- Go to the login screen. Open your inspector. Go to the Network tab.
- Log in and then find the login request that should appear in your network panel. Click the login request.
- The login request should have a Set-Cookie header on the response, and the cookie should be getting set successfully. If it is not, most browsers generally have a little yellow ⚠️ symbol that you can hover over to see why the cookie was rejected.
