_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Admin config

In addition to the default [field admin config](/docs/fields/overview#admin-config), the Text field type allows for the following `admin` properties:

**`placeholder`**

Set this property to define a placeholder string in the text input.

**`autoComplete`**

Set this property to a string that will be used for browser autocomplete.

**`rtl`**

Override the default text direction of the Admin panel for this field. Set to `true` to force right-to-left text direction.

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'pageTitle', // required
      type: 'text', // required
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```
