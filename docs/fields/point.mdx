| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`name`** \*      | To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-names)                                                                                            |
| **`label`**        | Used as a field label in the Admin panel and to name the generated GraphQL type.                                                                                                                                  |
| **`unique`**       | Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field.                                                                                                                                      |
| **`index`**        | Build an [index](/docs/database/overview) for this field to produce faster queries. To support location queries, point index defaults to `2dsphere`, to disable the index set to `false`. |
| **`validate`**     | Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin panel and the backend. [More](/docs/fields/overview#validation)                                                                      |
| **`saveToJWT`**    | If this field is top-level and nested in a config supporting [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config), include its data in the user JWT.                                                                     |

| **`access`**       | Provide field-based access control to denote what users can see and do with this field's data. [More](/docs/fields/overview#field-level-access-control)                                                           |
| **`hidden`**       | Restrict this field's visibility from all APIs entirely. Will still be saved to the database, but will not appear in any API or the Admin panel.                                                                  |

| **`required`**     | Require this field to have a value.                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'location',
      type: 'point',
      label: 'Location',
    },
  ],
}
```

### Querying

In order to do query based on the distance to another point, you can use the `near` operator. When querying using the near operator, the returned documents will be sorted by nearest first.
