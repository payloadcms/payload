The Blocks Field is one of the most flexible tools in Payload. It stores an array of objects, where each object is a “block” with its own schema. Unlike a simple array (where every item looks the same), blocks let you mix and match different content types in any order.

This makes Blocks perfect for building dynamic, editor-friendly experiences, such as:

- A page builder with blocks like `Quote`, `CallToAction`, `Slider`, or `Gallery`.
- A form builder with block types like `Text`, `Select`, or `Checkbox`.
- An event agenda where each timeslot could be a `Break`, `Presentation`, or `BreakoutSession`.

To add a Blocks Field, set the `type` to `blocks` in your [Field Config](./overview):

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyBlocksField: Field = {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  type: 'blocks',
  blocks: [
    // ...
  ],
  // highlight-end
}
```

This page is divided into two parts: first, the settings of the Blocks Field, and then the settings of the blocks inside it.

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Block Admin Options

To customize the appearance and behavior of the Blocks Field in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), you can use the `admin` option:

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyBlocksField: Field = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The Blocks Field inherits all of the default admin options from the base [Field Admin Config](./overview#admin-options), plus the following additional options:

| Option              | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`initCollapsed`** | Set the initial collapsed state                        |
| **`isSortable`**    | Disable order sorting by setting this value to `false` |

#### Customizing the way your block is rendered in Lexical

If you're using this block within the [Lexical editor](/docs/rich-text/overview), you can also customize how the block is rendered in the Lexical editor itself by specifying custom components.

- `admin.components.Label` - pass a custom React component here to customize the way that the label is rendered for this block
- `admin.components.Block` - pass a component here to completely override the way the block is rendered in Lexical with your own component

This is super handy if you'd like to present your editors with a very deliberate and nicely designed block "preview" right in your rich text.

For example, if you have a `gallery` block, you might want to actually render the gallery of images directly in your Lexical block. With the `admin.components.Block` property, you can do exactly that!

<Banner type="success">
  **Tip:** If you customize the way your block is rendered in Lexical, you can
  import utility components to easily edit / remove your block - so that you
  don't have to build all of this yourself.
</Banner>

To import these utility components for one of your custom blocks, you can import the following:

```ts
import {
  // Edit block buttons (choose the one that corresponds to your usage)
  // When clicked, this will open a drawer with your block's fields
  // so your editors can edit them
  InlineBlockEditButton,
  BlockEditButton,

  // Buttons that will remove this block from Lexical
  // (choose the one that corresponds to your usage)
  InlineBlockRemoveButton,
  BlockRemoveButton,

  // The label that should be rendered for an inline block
  InlineBlockLabel,

  // The default "container" that is rendered for an inline block
  // if you want to re-use it
  InlineBlockContainer,

  // The default "collapsible" UI that is rendered for a regular block
  // if you want to re-use it
  BlockCollapsible,
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client'
```

## Blocks Items

### Config Options

Blocks are defined as separate configs of their own.

<Banner type="success">
  **Tip:** Best practice is to define each block config in its own file, and
  then import them into your Blocks field as necessary. This way each block
  config can be easily shared between fields. For instance, using the "layout
  builder" example, you might want to feature a few of the same blocks in a Post
  collection as well as a Page collection. Abstracting into their own files
  trivializes their reusability.

| **`graphQL.singularName`** | Text to use for the GraphQL schema name. Auto-generated from slug if not defined. NOTE: this is set for deprecation, prefer `interfaceName`.                                        |
| **`dbName`**               | Custom table name for this block type when using SQL Database Adapter ([Postgres](/docs/database/postgres)). Auto-generated from slug if not defined.                               |
| **`custom`**               | Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)                                                                                                                           |

### Admin Options

Blocks are not fields, so they don’t inherit the base properties shared by all fields (not to be confused with the Blocks Field, documented above, which does). Here are their available admin options:

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **`images`**           | Custom images for the block in different UI contexts. Supports `icon` (20x20px for Lexical menus/toolbars) and `thumbnail` (3:2 ratio for block selection drawer). Each can be a URL string or `{ url, alt }` object. [More details](#block-image-guidelines). |     |

### Block Image Guidelines

The `images` property lets you provide custom images for each display context:

- **`images.icon`** - Small icon for Lexical editor menus and toolbars (displayed at 20x20px)
- **`images.thumbnail`** - Larger thumbnail for block selection drawer (3:2 aspect ratio)

Each can be either a plain URL string or an object `{ url: string, alt?: string }`.

#### Icon (`images.icon`)

Used in Lexical editor slash menus, toolbar dropdowns, and inline block menus.

**Requirements**:

- Displayed at **20x20 pixels**
- **Square images** (1:1 aspect ratio) work best
- Falls back to `images.thumbnail`, then to default block icon

**Recommendations**:

- Use SVG for crisp rendering at small sizes
- Keep designs simple with bold shapes
- Provide web-optimized images (SVG, PNG with transparency)

#### Thumbnail (`images.thumbnail`)

Used in the block selection drawer when editors add blocks to a blocks field.

**Requirements**:

- **3:2 aspect ratio** (e.g., 480x320, 600x400, 900x600)
- Images are scaled using `object-fit: cover`
- Non-matching aspect ratios will be **cropped** to fill the container

**Recommendations**:

- Use images with **3:2 aspect ratio** to avoid unwanted cropping
- Keep important visual content **centered** in your image
- Provide web-optimized images (JPEG, PNG, WebP) for faster loading

#### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Using both icon and thumbnail with alt text**

```ts
const QuoteBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'quote',
  admin: {
    images: {
      icon: {
        url: 'https://example.com/icons/quote-icon-20x20.svg',
        alt: 'Quote icon',
      },
      thumbnail: {
        url: 'https://example.com/thumbnails/quote-block-480x320.jpg',
        alt: 'Quote block',
      },
    },
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'quoteText',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

**Example 2: Using URL strings (no alt text)**

```ts
const CallToActionBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'cta',
  admin: {
    images: {
      icon: 'https://example.com/icons/cta-20x20.svg',
      thumbnail: 'https://example.com/thumbnails/cta-block-480x320.jpg',
    },
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'buttonText',
      type: 'text',
    },
  ],
}
```

**Example 3: Using only icon**

```ts
const DividerBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'divider',
  admin: {
    images: {
      icon: 'https://example.com/icons/divider-20x20.svg',
    },
  },
  fields: [],
}
```

If no `images` is provided, default graphics are displayed automatically in both contexts.

### blockType, blockName, and block.label

Each block stores two pieces of data alongside your fields. The `blockType` identifies which schema to use and it is exactly the block’s `slug`. The `blockName` is an optional label you can give to a block to make editing and scanning easier.

The **label** is shared by all blocks of the same type and is defined in the block config via `label` with a fallback to `slug`. On the other hand, the **blockName** is specific to each block individually. You can hide the editable name with `admin.disableBlockName`.

If you provide `admin.components.Label`, that component replaces both the name and the label in the Admin UI.

| Property      | Scope      | Source                                     | Visible in UI | Notes                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockType`   | Each block | The block’s `slug`                         | Not a header  | Used to resolve which block schema to render                                                       |
| `blockName`   | Each block | Editor input in the Admin                  | Yes           | Optional label; hide with `admin.disableBlockName` or replace with custom `admin.components.Label` |
| `block.label` | Block type | `label` in block config or `slug` fallback | Yes           | Shared by all blocks of that type. Can be replaced with custom `admin.components.Label`            |

### Custom Components

#### Field

##### Server Component

```tsx
import type React from 'react'
import { BlocksField } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import type { BlocksFieldServerComponent } from 'payload'

export const CustomBlocksFieldServer: BlocksFieldServerComponent = ({
  clientField,
  path,
  schemaPath,
  permissions,
}) => {
  return (
    <BlocksField
      field={clientField}
      path={path}
      schemaPath={schemaPath}
      permissions={permissions}
    />
  )
}
```

##### Client Component

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { BlocksField } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import type { BlocksFieldClientComponent } from 'payload'

export const CustomBlocksFieldClient: BlocksFieldClientComponent = (props) => {
  return <BlocksField {...props} />
}
```

#### Label

##### Server Component

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { FieldLabel } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import type { BlocksFieldLabelServerComponent } from 'payload'

export const CustomBlocksFieldLabelServer: BlocksFieldLabelServerComponent = ({
  clientField,
  path,
}) => {
  return (
    <FieldLabel
      label={clientField?.label || clientField?.name}
      path={path}
      required={clientField?.required}
    />
  )
}
```

##### Client Component

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { FieldLabel } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import type { BlocksFieldLabelClientComponent } from 'payload'

export const CustomBlocksFieldLabelClient: BlocksFieldLabelClientComponent = ({
  label,
  path,
  required,
}) => {
  return (
    <FieldLabel
      label={field?.label || field?.name}
      path={path}
      required={field?.required}
    />
  )
}
```

## Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.js`

```ts
import { Block, CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

const QuoteBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'Quote', // required
  imageURL: 'https://google.com/path/to/image.jpg',
  imageAltText: 'A nice thumbnail image to show what this block looks like',
  interfaceName: 'QuoteBlock', // optional
  fields: [
    // required
    {
      name: 'quoteHeader',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'quoteText',
      type: 'text',
    },
  ],
}

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'layout', // required
      type: 'blocks', // required
      minRows: 1,
      maxRows: 20,
      blocks: [
        // required
        QuoteBlock,
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

## Block References

If you have multiple blocks used in multiple places, your Payload Config can grow in size, potentially sending more data to the client and requiring more processing on the server. However, you can optimize performance by defining each block **once** in your Payload Config and then referencing its slug wherever it's used instead of passing the entire block config.

To do this, define the block in the `blocks` array of the Payload Config. Then, in the Blocks Field, pass the block slug to the `blockReferences` array - leaving the `blocks` array empty for compatibility reasons.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { lexicalEditor, BlocksFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

// Payload Config
const config = buildConfig({
  // Define the block once
  blocks: [
    {
      slug: 'TextBlock',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'text',
          type: 'text',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'collection1',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'content',
          type: 'blocks',
          // Reference the block by slug
          blockReferences: ['TextBlock'],
          blocks: [], // Required to be empty, for compatibility reasons
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      slug: 'collection2',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'editor',
          type: 'richText',
          editor: lexicalEditor({
            features: [
              BlocksFeature({
                // Same reference can be reused anywhere, even in the lexical editor, without incurred performance hit
                blocks: ['TextBlock'],
              }),
            ],
          }),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Reminder:**
  Blocks referenced in the `blockReferences` array are treated as isolated from the collection / global config. This has the following implications:

1. The block config cannot be modified or extended in the collection config. It will be identical everywhere it's referenced.
2. Access control for blocks referenced in the `blockReferences` are run only once - data from the collection will not be available in the block's access control.
   </Banner>

## TypeScript

As you build your own Block configs, you might want to store them in separate files but retain typing accordingly. To do so, you can import and use Payload's `Block` type:

```ts
import type { Block } from 'payload'
```

## Conditional Blocks

Blocks can be conditionally enabled using the `filterOptions` property on the blocks field. It allows you to provide a function that returns which block slugs should be available based on the given context.

### Behavior

- `filterOptions` is re-evaluated as part of the form state request, whenever the document data changes.
- If a block is present in the field but no longer allowed by `filterOptions`, a validation error will occur when saving.

### Example

```ts
{
  name: 'blocksWithDynamicFilterOptions',
  type: 'blocks',
  filterOptions: ({ siblingData }) => {
    return siblingData?.enabledBlocks?.length
      ? [siblingData.enabledBlocks] // allow only the matching block
      : true // allow all blocks if no value is set
  },
  blocks: [
    { slug: 'block1', fields: [{ type: 'text', name: 'block1Text' }] },
    { slug: 'block2', fields: [{ type: 'text', name: 'block2Text' }] },
    { slug: 'block3', fields: [{ type: 'text', name: 'block3Text' }] },
    // ...
  ],
}
```

In this example, the list of available blocks is determined by the enabledBlocks sibling field. If no value is set, all blocks remain available.
