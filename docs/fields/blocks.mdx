  The Blocks field type is **incredibly powerful** and can be used as a
  *layout builder* as well as to define any other flexible content model you can think of. It
  stores an array of objects, where each object must match the shape of one of your provided block
  configs.

**Example uses:**

- A layout builder tool that grants editors to design highly customizable page or post layouts. Blocks could include
  configs such as `Quote`, `CallToAction`, `Slider`, `Content`, `Gallery`, or others.
- A form builder tool where available block configs might be `Text`, `Select`, or `Checkbox`.
- Virtual event agenda "timeslots" where a timeslot could either be a `Break`, a `Presentation`, or a `BreakoutSession`.

### Field config

| **`localized`**    | Enable localization for this field. Requires [localization to be enabled](/docs/configuration/localization) in the Base config. If enabled, a separate, localized set of all data within this field will be kept, so there is no need to specify each nested field as `localized`. |
| **`unique`**       | Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Admin Config

In addition to the default [field admin config](/docs/fields/overview#admin-config), you can adjust the following
properties:

| Option              | Description                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **`initCollapsed`** | Set the initial collapsed state |
| **`isSortable`** | Disable block order sorting by setting this value to `false` |

### Block configs

Blocks are defined as separate configs of their own.

<Banner type="success">
  **Tip:**

  Best practice is to define each block config in its own file, and then import them into your
  Blocks field as necessary. This way each block config can be easily shared between fields. For
  instance, using the "layout builder" example, you might want to feature a few of the same blocks
  in a Post collection as well as a Page collection. Abstracting into their own files trivializes
  their reusability.

| **`slug`** \*              | Identifier for this block type. Will be saved on each block as the `blockType` property.                                                                                            |
| **`fields`** \*            | Array of fields to be stored in this block.                                                                                                                                         |
| **`labels`**               | Customize the block labels that appear in the Admin dashboard. Auto-generated from slug if not defined.                                                                             |
| **`imageURL`**             | Provide a custom image thumbnail to help editors identify this block in the Admin UI.                                                                                               |
| **`imageAltText`**         | Customize this block's image thumbnail alt text.                                                                                                                                    |
| **`interfaceName`**        | Create a top level, reusable [Typescript interface](/docs/typescript/generating-types#custom-field-interfaces) & [GraphQL type](/docs/graphql/graphql-schema#custom-field-schemas). |
| **`graphQL.singularName`** | Text to use for the GraphQL schema name. Auto-generated from slug if not defined. NOTE: this is set for deprecation, prefer `interfaceName`.                                        |
| **`dbName`**               | Custom table name for this block type when using SQL database adapter ([Postgres](/docs/database/postgres)). Auto-generated from slug if not defined.
| **`custom`**               | Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)                                                                                                                           |

#### Auto-generated data per block

In addition to the field data that you define on each block, Payload will store two additional properties on each block:

**`blockType`**

The `blockType` is saved as the slug of the block that has been selected.

**`blockName`**

The Admin panel provides each block with a `blockName` field which optionally allows editors to label their blocks for
better editability and readability.

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.js`

```ts
import { Block, CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

const QuoteBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'Quote', // required
  imageURL: 'https://google.com/path/to/image.jpg',
  imageAltText: 'A nice thumbnail image to show what this block looks like',
  interfaceName: 'QuoteBlock', // optional
  fields: [
    // required
    {
      name: 'quoteHeader',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'quoteText',
      type: 'text',
    },
  ],
}

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'layout', // required
      type: 'blocks', // required
      minRows: 1,
      maxRows: 20,
      blocks: [
        // required
        QuoteBlock,
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### TypeScript

As you build your own Block configs, you might want to store them in separate files but retain typing accordingly. To do
so, you can import and use Payload's `Block` type:

```ts
import type { Block } from 'payload/types'
```
