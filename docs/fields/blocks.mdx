The Blocks Field is <strong>incredibly powerful</strong>, storing an array of objects based on the fields that your define, where each item in the array is a "block" with its own unique schema.

Blocks are a great way to create a flexible content model that can be used to build a wide variety of content types, including:

- A layout builder tool that grants editors to design highly customizable page or post layouts. Blocks could include configs such as `Quote`, `CallToAction`, `Slider`, `Content`, `Gallery`, or others.
- A form builder tool where available block configs might be `Text`, `Select`, or `Checkbox`.
- Virtual event agenda "timeslots" where a timeslot could either be a `Break`, a `Presentation`, or a `BreakoutSession`.

To add a Blocks Field, set the `type` to `blocks` in your [Field Config](./overview):

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyBlocksField: Field = {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  type: 'blocks',
  blocks: [
    // ...
  ],
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Admin Options

The customize the appearance and behavior of the Blocks Field in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), you can use the `admin` option:

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyBlocksField: Field = {
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The Blocks Field inherits all of the default options from the base [Field Admin Config](../admin/fields#admin-options), plus the following additional options:

| Option              | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **`initCollapsed`**    | Set the initial collapsed state |
| **`isSortable`**       | Disable order sorting by setting this value to `false` |

#### Customizing the way your block is rendered in Lexical

If you're using this block within the [Lexical editor](/docs/lexical/overview), you can also customize how the block is rendered in the Lexical editor itself by specifying custom components.

- `admin.components.Label` - pass a custom React component here to customize the way that the label is rendered for this block
- `admin.components.Block` - pass a component here to completely override the way the block is rendered in Lexical with your own component

This is super handy if you'd like to present your editors with a very deliberate and nicely designed block "preview" right in your rich text.

For example, if you have a `gallery` block, you might want to actually render the gallery of images directly in your Lexical block. With the `admin.components.Block` property, you can do exactly that!

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Tip:</strong><br/>
  If you customize the way your block is rendered in Lexical, you can import utility components to easily edit / remove your block - so that you don't have to build all of this yourself.
</Banner>

To import these utility components for one of your custom blocks, you can import the following:

```ts
import { 
  // Edit block buttons (choose the one that corresponds to your usage)
  // When clicked, this will open a drawer with your block's fields
  // so your editors can edit them
  InlineBlockEditButton,
  BlockEditButton,

  // Buttons that will remove this block from Lexical 
  // (choose the one that corresponds to your usage)
  InlineBlockRemoveButton,
  BlockRemoveButton,

  // The label that should be rendered for an inline block
  InlineBlockLabel,
  
  // The default "container" that is rendered for an inline block
  // if you want to re-use it
  InlineBlockContainer,

  // The default "collapsible" UI that is rendered for a regular block
  // if you want to re-use it
  BlockCollapsible,
  
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/client'
```

## Block Configs

Blocks are defined as separate configs of their own.

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  <br />
  Best practice is to define each block config in its own file, and then import them into your
  Blocks field as necessary. This way each block config can be easily shared between fields. For
  instance, using the "layout builder" example, you might want to feature a few of the same blocks
  in a Post collection as well as a Page collection. Abstracting into their own files trivializes
  their reusability.

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`slug`** \*              | Identifier for this block type. Will be saved on each block as the `blockType` property.                                                                                            |
| **`fields`** \*            | Array of fields to be stored in this block.                                                                                                                                         |
| **`labels`**               | Customize the block labels that appear in the Admin dashboard. Auto-generated from slug if not defined.                                                                             |
| **`imageURL`**             | Provide a custom image thumbnail to help editors identify this block in the Admin UI.                                                                                               |
| **`imageAltText`**         | Customize this block's image thumbnail alt text.                                                                                                                                    |
| **`interfaceName`**        | Create a top level, reusable [Typescript interface](/docs/typescript/generating-types#custom-field-interfaces) & [GraphQL type](/docs/graphql/graphql-schema#custom-field-schemas). |
| **`graphQL.singularName`** | Text to use for the GraphQL schema name. Auto-generated from slug if not defined. NOTE: this is set for deprecation, prefer `interfaceName`.                                        |
| **`dbName`**               | Custom table name for this block type when using SQL Database Adapter ([Postgres](/docs/database/postgres)). Auto-generated from slug if not defined.
| **`custom`**               | Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)                                                                                                                           |

### Auto-generated data per block

In addition to the field data that you define on each block, Payload will store two additional properties on each block:

**`blockType`**

The `blockType` is saved as the slug of the block that has been selected.

**`blockName`**

The Admin Panel provides each block with a `blockName` field which optionally allows editors to label their blocks for better editability and readability.

## Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.js`

```ts
import { Block, CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

const QuoteBlock: Block = {
  slug: 'Quote', // required
  imageURL: 'https://google.com/path/to/image.jpg',
  imageAltText: 'A nice thumbnail image to show what this block looks like',
  interfaceName: 'QuoteBlock', // optional
  fields: [
    // required
    {
      name: 'quoteHeader',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'quoteText',
      type: 'text',
    },
  ],
}

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'layout', // required
      type: 'blocks', // required
      minRows: 1,
      maxRows: 20,
      blocks: [
        // required
        QuoteBlock,
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

## TypeScript

As you build your own Block configs, you might want to store them in separate files but retain typing accordingly. To do so, you can import and use Payload's `Block` type:

```ts
import type { Block } from 'payload'
```
