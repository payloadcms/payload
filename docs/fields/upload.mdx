The Upload Field allows for the selection of a Document from a Collection supporting [Uploads](../upload/overview), and
formats the selection as a thumbnail in the Admin Panel.

Upload fields are useful for a variety of use cases, such as:

- To provide a `Page` with a featured image
- To allow for a `Product` to deliver a downloadable asset like PDF or MP3
- To give a layout building block the ability to feature a background image

To create an Upload Field, set the `type` to `upload` in your [Field Config](./overview):

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyUploadField: Field = {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  type: 'upload',
  relationTo: 'media',
  // highlight-end
}
```

  **Important:**
  To use the Upload Field, you must have a [Collection](../configuration/collections) configured to allow [Uploads](../upload/overview).

## Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'backgroundImage', // required
      type: 'upload', // required
      relationTo: 'media', // required
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Filtering upload options

Options can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](/docs/queries/overview), which will be used both
for validating input and filtering available uploads in the UI.

The `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to
prevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be
called with an argument object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `relationTo`  | The collection `slug` to filter against, limited to this field's `relationTo` property                |
| `data`        | An object containing the full collection or global document currently being edited                    |
| `siblingData` | An object containing document data that is scoped to only fields within the same parent of this field |
| `id`          | The `id` of the current document being edited. `id` is `undefined` during the `create` operation      |
| `user`        | An object containing the currently authenticated user                                                 |
| `req`         | The Payload Request, which contains references to `payload`, `user`, `locale`, and more.              |

### Example#filter-options-example

```ts
const uploadField = {
  name: 'image',
  type: 'upload',
  relationTo: 'media',
  filterOptions: {
    mimeType: { contains: 'image' },
  },
}
```

You can learn more about writing queries [here](/docs/queries/overview).

  **Note:**

  When an upload field has both **filterOptions** and a custom{' '}
  **validate** function, the api will not validate **filterOptions**{' '}
  unless you call the default upload field validation function imported from{' '}
  **payload/shared** in your validate function.

## Bi-directional relationships

The `upload` field on its own is used to reference documents in an upload collection. This can be considered a "one-way"
relationship. If you wish to allow an editor to visit the upload document and see where it is being used, you may use
the `join` field in the upload enabled collection. Read more about bi-directional relationships using
the [Join field](./join)
