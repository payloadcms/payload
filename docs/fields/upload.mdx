## Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'backgroundImage', // required
      type: 'upload', // required
      relationTo: 'media', // required
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Filtering upload options

Options can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](/docs/queries/overview), which will be used both
for validating input and filtering available uploads in the UI.

The `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to
prevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be
called with an argument object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `relationTo`  | The collection `slug` to filter against, limited to this field's `relationTo` property                |
| `data`        | An object containing the full collection or global document currently being edited                    |
| `siblingData` | An object containing document data that is scoped to only fields within the same parent of this field |
| `id`          | The `id` of the current document being edited. `id` is `undefined` during the `create` operation      |
| `user`        | An object containing the currently authenticated user                                                 |

## Example

```ts
const uploadField = {
  name: 'image',
  type: 'upload',
  relationTo: 'media',
  filterOptions: {
    mimeType: { contains: 'image' },
  },
}
```
