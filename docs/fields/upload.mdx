| **`name`** *         | To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database.  |
| **`*relationTo`** *  | Provide a single collection `slug` to allow this field to accept a relation to. <strong>Note: the related collection must be configured to support Uploads.</strong> |
| **`filterOptions`**  | A query to filter which options appear in the UI and validate against. [More](#filtering-relationship-options). |
| **`maxDepth`**       | Sets a number limit on iterations of related documents to populate when queried. [Depth](/docs/getting-started/concepts#depth) |
| **`label`**          | Used as a field label in the Admin panel and to name the generated GraphQL type. |
| **`unique`**         | Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field. |
| **`validate`**       | Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin panel and the backend. [More](/docs/fields/overview#validation) |
| **`index`**          | Build a [MongoDB index](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/) for this field to produce faster queries. Set this field to `true` if your users will perform queries on this field's data often. |
