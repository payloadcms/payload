  **Important:**

  To use this field, you need to have a Collection configured to allow Uploads. For more

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'backgroundImage', // required
      type: 'upload', // required
      relationTo: 'media', // required
      required: true,
    },
  ],
}
```

### Filtering upload options

Options can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](/docs/queries/overview), which will be used both
for validating input and filtering available uploads in the UI.

The `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to
prevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be
called with an argument object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `relationTo`  | The `relationTo` to filter against (as defined on the field)                         |
| `data`        | An object of the full collection or global document currently being edited           |
| `siblingData` | An object of the document data limited to fields within the same parent to the field |
| `id`          | The value of the collection `id`, will be `undefined` on create request              |
| `user`        | The currently authenticated user object                                              |

**Example:**

```ts
const uploadField = {
  name: 'image',
  type: 'upload',
  relationTo: 'media',
  filterOptions: {
    mimeType: { contains: 'image' },
  },
}
```

You can learn more about writing queries [here](/docs/queries/overview).

  **Note:**

  When an upload field has both **filterOptions** and a custom{' '}
  **validate** function, the api will not validate **filterOptions**{' '}
  unless you call the default upload field validation function imported from{' '}
  **payload/fields/validations** in your validate function.
