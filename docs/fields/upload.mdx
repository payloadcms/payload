  <strong>Important:</strong><br/>
  To use this field, you need to have a Collection configured to allow Uploads. For more information, <a href="/docs/upload/overview">click here</a> to read about how to enable Uploads on a collection by collection basis.

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`
```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example-collection',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'backgroundImage', // required
      type: 'upload', // required
      relationTo: 'media', // required
      required: true,
    }
  ]
}

```

### Filtering upload options

Options can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](/docs/queries/overview), which will be used both for validating input and filtering available uploads in the UI.

The `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query directly, or a function that returns one. When using a function, it will be called with an argument object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------|
| `relationTo`       | The `relationTo` to filter against (as defined on the field) |
| `data`             | An object of the full collection or global document currently being edited |
| `siblingData`      | An object of the document data limited to fields within the same parent to the field |
| `id`               | The value of the collection `id`, will be `undefined` on create request |
| `user`             | The currently authenticated user object |

**Example:**

```ts
const uploadField = {
  name: 'image',
  type: 'upload',
  relationTo: 'media',
  filterOptions: {
    mimeType: { contains: 'image' },
  },
};
```

  <strong>Note:</strong><br/>
  When an upload field has both <strong>filterOptions</strong> and a custom <strong>validate</strong> function, the api will not validate <strong>filterOptions</strong> unless you call the default upload field validation function imported from <strong>payload/fields/validations</strong> in your validate function.
