The Rich Text Field lets editors write and format dynamic content in a familiar interface. The content is saved as JSON in the database and can be converted to HTML or any other format needed.

Consistent with Payload's goal of making you learn as little of Payload as possible, customizing and using the Rich Text Editor does not involve learning how to develop for a Payload rich text editor.

Instead, you can invest your time and effort into learning the underlying open-source tools that will allow you to apply your learnings elsewhere as well.

## Admin Options

To customize the appearance and behavior of the Rich Text Field in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), you can use the `admin` option. The Rich Text Field inherits all the default options from the base [Field Admin Config](./overview#admin-options).

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload'

export const MyRichTextField: Field = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

Further customization can be done with editor-specific options.

## Editor-specific Options

For a ton more editor-specific options, including how to build custom rich text elements directly into your editor,
take a look at the [rich text editor documentation](../rich-text/overview).
