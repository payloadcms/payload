  The Rich Text field is a powerful way to allow editors to write dynamic content. The content is
  saved as JSON in the database and can be converted into any format, including HTML, that you need.

Payload's rich text field is built on an "adapter pattern" which lets you specify which rich text editor you'd like to use.

Right now, Payload is officially supporting two rich text editors:

1. [SlateJS](/docs/rich-text/slate) - stable, backwards-compatible with 1.0
2. [Lexical](/docs/rich-text/lexical) - beta, where things will be moving

  **Consistent with Payload's goal of making you learn as little of Payload as possible, customizing and using the Rich Text Editor does not involve learning how to develop for a __Payload__ rich text editor.** Instead, you can invest your time and effort into learning the underlying open-source tools that will allow you to apply your learnings elsewhere as well.

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Admin config

In addition to the default [field admin config](/docs/fields/overview#admin-config), the Rich Text editor allows for the following admin properties:

**`placeholder`**

Set this property to define a placeholder string in the text input.

**`hideGutter`**

Set this property to `true` to hide this field's gutter within the admin panel. The field gutter is rendered as a vertical line and padding, but often if this field is nested within a Group, Block, or Array, you may want to hide the gutter.

**`rtl`**

Override the default text direction of the Admin panel for this field. Set to `true` to force right-to-left text direction.

### Editor-specific options

For a ton more editor-specific options, including how to build custom rich text elements directly into your editor, take a look at either the [Slate docs](/docs/rich-text/slate) or the [Lexical docs](/docs/rich-text/lexical) depending on which editor you're using.
