Globals are in many ways similar to [Collections](../configuration/collections), except that they correspond to only a single Document. You can define as many Globals as your application needs. Each Global Document is stored in the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates a [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) used to manage your Documents.

Globals are the primary way to structure singletons in Payload, such as a header navigation, site-wide banner alerts, or app-wide localized strings. Each Global can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Global Config, use the `globals` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  globals: [ // highlight-line
    // Your Globals go here
  ],
})
```

  **Tip:**
  If you have more than one Global that share the same structure, consider using a [Collection](../configuration/collections) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Globals in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](./overview).

Here is what a simple Global Config might look like:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const Nav: GlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'nav',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'items',
      type: 'array',
      required: true,
      maxRows: 8,
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'page',
          type: 'relationship',
          relationTo: 'pages', // "pages" is the slug of an existing collection
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Global. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

[Global Access Control](../access-control/globals) determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Global Document. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) documentation.

### Hooks

[Global Hooks](../hooks/globals) allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

### Admin Options

You can customize the way that the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) behaves on a Global-by-Global basis. To learn more, go to the [Global Admin Options](../admin/globals) documentation.

## GraphQL

You can completely disable GraphQL for this global by passing `graphQL: false` to your global config. This will completely disable all queries, mutations, and types from appearing in your GraphQL schema.

You can also pass an object to the global's `graphQL` property, which allows you to define the following properties:

| Option                 | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`name`**             | Override the name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.                   |
| **`disableQueries`**   | Disable all GraphQL queries that correspond to this global by passing `true`.       |
| **`disableMutations`** | Disable all GraphQL mutations that correspond to this global by passing `true`.     |

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your Global configs easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Global Config, `GlobalConfig` and `SanitizeGlobalConfig`.

The `GlobalConfig` type represents a raw Global Config in its full form, where only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedGlobalConfig` type represents a Global Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { GlobalConfig, SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload'
```
