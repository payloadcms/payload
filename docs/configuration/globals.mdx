Globals are in many ways similar to [Collections](./collections), except that they correspond to only a single Document. You can define as many Globals as your application needs. Each Global Document is stored in the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates a [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) used to manage your Documents.

Globals are the primary way to structure singletons in Payload, such as a header navigation, site-wide banner alerts, or app-wide localized strings. Each Global can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Global Config, use the `globals` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  globals: [
    // highlight-line
    // Your Globals go here
  ],
})
```

  **Tip:** If you have more than one Global that share the same structure,
  consider using a [Collection](./collections) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Globals in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](./overview).

Here is what a simple Global Config might look like:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const Nav: GlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'nav',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'items',
      type: 'array',
      required: true,
      maxRows: 8,
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'page',
          type: 'relationship',
          relationTo: 'pages', // "pages" is the slug of an existing collection
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Global. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

[Global Access Control](../access-control/globals) determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Global Document. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) documentation.

### Hooks

[Global Hooks](../hooks/globals) allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

## Admin Options

The behavior of Globals within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) can be fully customized to fit the needs of your application. This includes grouping or hiding their navigation links, adding [Custom Components](../custom-components/overview), setting page metadata, and more.

To configure Admin Options for Globals, use the `admin` property in your Global Config:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyGlobal: GlobalConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`       | Text or localization object used to group Collection and Global links in the admin navigation. Set to `false` to hide the link from the navigation while keeping its routes accessible. |
| `hidden`      | Set to true or a function, called with the current user, returning true to exclude this Global from navigation and admin routing.                                                       |
| `components`  | Swap in your own React components to be used within this Global. [More details](#custom-components).                                                                                    |
| `preview`     | Function to generate a preview URL within the Admin Panel for this Global that can point to your app. [More details](../admin/preview).                                                 |
| `livePreview` | Enable real-time editing for instant visual feedback of your front-end application. [More details](../live-preview/overview).                                                           |
| `hideAPIURL`  | Hides the "API URL" meta field while editing documents within this collection.                                                                                                          |
| `meta`        | Page metadata overrides to apply to this Global within the Admin Panel. [More details](../admin/metadata).                                                                              |

### Custom Components

Globals can set their own [Custom Components](../custom-components/overview) which only apply to Global-specific UI within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). This includes elements such as the Save Button, or entire layouts such as the Edit View.

To override Global Components, use the `admin.components` property in your Global Config:

```ts
import type { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyGlobal: SanitizedGlobalConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      // highlight-line
      // ...
    },
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

#### General

| Option     | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `elements` | Override or create new elements within the Edit View. [More details](#edit-view-options).               |
| `views`    | Override or create new views within the Admin Panel. [More details](../custom-components/custom-views). |

#### Edit View Options

```ts
import type { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyGlobal: SanitizedGlobalConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      elements: {
        // highlight-line
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SaveButton`      | Replace the default Save Button with a Custom Component. [Drafts](../versions/drafts) must be disabled. [More details](../custom-components/edit-view#save-button).                                          |

## GraphQL

You can completely disable GraphQL for this global by passing `graphQL: false` to your global config. This will completely disable all queries, mutations, and types from appearing in your GraphQL schema.

You can also pass an object to the global's `graphQL` property, which allows you to define the following properties:

| Option             | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Override the name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.               |
| `disableQueries`   | Disable all GraphQL queries that correspond to this global by passing `true`.   |
| `disableMutations` | Disable all GraphQL mutations that correspond to this global by passing `true`. |

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your Global configs easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Global Config, `GlobalConfig` and `SanitizeGlobalConfig`.

The `GlobalConfig` type represents a raw Global Config in its full form, where only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedGlobalConfig` type represents a Global Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { GlobalConfig, SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload'
```
