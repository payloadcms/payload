Payload Collections are defined through configs of their own, and you can define as many as your application needs. Each Collection will scaffold a MongoDB collection automatically based on fields that you define.

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.

## Options

| Option           | Description  |
| ---------------- | -------------|
| **`slug`** *     | Unique, URL-friendly string that will act as an identifier for this Collection. |
| **`fields`** *   | Array of field types that will determine the structure and functionality of the data stored within this Collection. [Click here](/docs/fields/overview) for a full list of field types as well as how to configure them. |
| **`labels`**     | Singular and plural labels for use in identifying this Collection throughout Payload. Auto-generated from slug if not defined. |
| **`description`**| Text or React component to display below the Collection label in the List view to give editors more information. |
| **`admin`**      | Admin-specific configuration. See below for [more detail](#admin-options). |
| **`hooks`**      | Entry points to "tie in" to Collection actions at specific points. [More](/docs/hooks/overview#collection-hooks) |
| **`access`**     | Provide access control functions to define exactly who should be able to do what with Documents in this Collection. [More](/docs/access-control/overview/#collections) |
| **`auth`**       | Specify options if you would like this Collection to feature authentication. For more, consult the [Authentication](/docs/authentication/config) documentation. |
| **`upload`**     | Specify options if you would like this Collection to support file uploads. For more, consult the [Uploads](/docs/upload/overview) documentation. |
| **`timestamps`** | Set to false to disable documents' automatically generated `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps. |
| **`versions`**   | Set to true to enable default options, or configure with object properties. [More](/docs/versions/overview#collection-config)|

*\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required.*

#### Simple collection example

```js
const Orders = {
	slug: 'orders',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'total',
			type: 'number',
			required: true,
		},
		{
			name: 'placedBy',
			type: 'relationship',
			relationTo: 'customers',
			required: true,
		}
	]
}
```

#### More collection config examples

You can find an assortment of [example collection configs](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/demo/collections) in the Payload source code on GitHub.

### Admin options

You can customize the way that the Admin panel behaves on a collection-by-collection basis by defining the `admin` property on a collection's config.

| Option                       | Description  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------|
| `useAsTitle`                 | Specify a top-level field to use for a document title throughout the Admin panel. If no field is defined, the ID of the document is used as the title. |
| `defaultColumns`             | Array of field names that correspond to which columns to show by default in this collection's List view. |
| `disableDuplicate `          | Disables the "Duplicate" button while editing documents within this collection. |
| `enableRichTextRelationship` | The [Rich Text](/docs/fields/rich-text) field features a `Relationship` element which allows for users to automatically reference related documents within their rich text. Set to `true` by default. |
| `preview`                    | Function to generate preview URLS within the Admin panel that can point to your app. [More](#preview). |
| `components`                 | Swap in your own React components to be used within this collection. [More](/docs/admin/components#collections) |

### Preview

Collection `admin` options can accept a `preview` function that will be used to generate a link pointing to the frontend of your app to preview data.

If the function is specified, a Preview button will automatically appear in the corresponding collection's Edit view. Clicking the Preview button will link to the URL that is generated by the function.

**The preview function accepts two arguments:**

1. The document being edited
1. An `options` object, containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged in user's JWT.

**Example collection with preview function:**

```js
{
	slug: 'posts',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'slug',
			type: 'text',
			required: true,
		}
	]
	admin: {
		preview: (doc, { locale }) => {
			if (doc?.slug) {
				return `https://bigbird.com/preview/posts/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`,
			}

			return null;
		}
	}
}
```

### Access control

You can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with documents in a collection) on a collection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](/docs/access-control/overview) docs.

### Hooks

Hooks are a powerful way to extend collection functionality and execute your own logic, and can be defined on a collection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](/docs/hooks/overview) documentation.

### Field types

Collections support all field types that Payload has to offer—including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the way to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](/docs/fields/overview) to learn more about field types.

### TypeScript

You can import collection types as follows:

```js
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

// This is the type used for incoming collection configs.
// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.
```

```js
import { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

// This is the type used after an incoming collection config is fully sanitized.
// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.
```
