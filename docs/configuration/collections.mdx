A Collection is a group of records, called Documents, that all share a common schema. You can define as many Collections as your application needs. Each Document in a Collection is stored in the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates a [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) used to manage your Documents.

Collections are also used to achieve [Authentication](../authentication/overview) in Payload. By defining a Collection with `auth` options, that Collection receives additional operations to support user authentication.

Collections are the primary way to structure recurring data in your application, such as users, products, pages, posts, and other types of content that you might want to manage. Each Collection can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Collection Config, use the `collection` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [
    // highlight-line
    // Your Collections go here
  ],
})
```

  **Tip:** If your Collection is only ever meant to contain a single Document,
  consider using a [Global](./globals) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](./overview).

Here is what a simple Collection Config might look like:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
    },
  ],
}
```

  [Examples](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples)
  directories in the Payload repository.

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Documents within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

[Collection Access Control](../access-control/collections) determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Document within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) documentation.

### Hooks

[Collection Hooks](../hooks/collections) allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

### Orderable

When `orderable` is enabled, Payload uses [fractional indexing](https://observablehq.com/@dgreensp/implementing-fractional-indexing) to efficiently manage document order. When enabled on collections, this allows you to manually drag and drop documents in the Admin Panel to reorder them, as well as programmatically set the order of documents via the Local API, REST API, or GraphQL API.

Orderable can also be added to [joins fields](../fields/join).

#### Fractional indexing

If you need to generate order keys programmatically (e.g., when creating documents via the Local API with a specific order), you can import the utilities directly:

```ts
import { generateKeyBetween, generateNKeysBetween } from 'payload/shared'

// Generate a key between two existing keys (or null for start/end)
const newKey = generateKeyBetween('a0', 'a1')

// Generate a key at the start (before 'a0')
const startKey = generateKeyBetween(null, 'a0')

// Generate a key at the end (after 'a1')
const endKey = generateKeyBetween('a1', null)

// Generate multiple keys between two existing keys
const keys = generateNKeysBetween('a0', 'a1', 5)
```

These utilities are useful when you need fine-grained control over document ordering, such as inserting documents at specific positions or batch-creating documents with predetermined order.

## Admin Options

The behavior of Collections within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) can be fully customized to fit the needs of your application. This includes grouping or hiding their navigation links, adding [Custom Components](../custom-components/overview), selecting which fields to display in the List View, and more.

To configure Admin Options for Collections, use the `admin` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note:** If you set `useAsTitle` to a relationship or join field, it will use
  only the ID of the related document(s) as the title. To display a specific
  field (i.e. title) from the related document instead, create a virtual field
  that extracts the desired data, and set `useAsTitle` to that virtual field.
</Banner>

### Custom Components

Collections can set their own [Custom Components](../custom-components/overview) which only apply to Collection-specific UI within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). This includes elements such as the Save Button, or entire layouts such as the Edit View.

To override Collection Components, use the `admin.components` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      // highlight-line
      // ...
    },
  },
}

### Pagination

All Collections receive their own List View which displays a paginated list of documents that can be sorted and filtered. The pagination behavior of the List View can be customized on a per-Collection basis, and uses the same [Pagination](../queries/pagination) API that Payload provides.

To configure pagination options, use the `admin.pagination` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    pagination: {
      defaultLimit: 10,
      limits: [10, 20, 50],
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option         | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultLimit` | Integer that specifies the default per-page limit that should be used. Defaults to 10.              |
| `limits`       | Provide an array of integers to use as per-page options for admins to choose from in the List View. |

### List Searchable Fields

In the List View, there is a "search" box that allows you to quickly find a document through a simple text search. By default, it searches on the ID field. If defined, the `admin.useAsTitle` field is used. Or, you can explicitly define which fields to search based on the needs of your application.

To define which fields should be searched, use the `admin.listSearchableFields` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    listSearchableFields: ['title', 'slug'],
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Tip:** If you are adding `listSearchableFields`, make sure you index each of
  these fields so your admin queries can remain performant.
</Banner>

## Enable List View Select API

When `true`, the List View will use the [Select API](../queries/select) to query only the _active_ columns as opposed to entire documents. This can greatly improve performance, especially for collections with large documents or many fields.

To enable this, set `enableListViewSelectAPI: true` in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // ...
    // highlight-start
    enableListViewSelectAPI: true,
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

<Banner type="info">
  **Note:** The `enableListViewSelectAPI` property is labeled as experimental,
  as it will likely become the default behavior in v4 and be deprecated.
</Banner>

Enabling this feature may cause unexpected behavior in some cases, however, such as when using hooks that rely on the full document data.

For example, if your component relies on a "title" field, this field will no longer be populated if the column is inactive:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  fields: [
    // ...
    {
      name: 'myField',
      type: 'text',
      hooks: {
        afterRead: [
          ({ doc }) => doc.title, // The `title` field will no longer be populated by default, unless the column is active
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

To ensure title is always present, you will need to add that field to the [`forceSelect`](../queries/select) property in your Collection Config:

```ts
export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  forceSelect: {
    title: true,
  },
}
```

### Format Document URLs

The `formatDocURL` function allows you to customize how document links are generated in the List View. This is useful for disabling links for certain documents, redirecting to custom destinations, or modifying URLs based on user context or document state.

To define a custom document URL formatter, use the `admin.formatDocURL` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    formatDocURL: ({ doc, defaultURL, req, collectionSlug, viewType }) => {
      // Disable linking for documents with specific status
      if (doc.status === 'private') {
        return null
      }

      // Custom destination for featured posts
      if (doc.featured) {
        return '/admin/featured-posts'
      }

      // Add query parameters based on user role
      if (req.user?.role === 'admin') {
        return defaultURL + '?admin=true'
      }

      // Use default URL for all other cases
      return defaultURL
    },
  },
}
```

The `formatDocURL` function receives the following arguments:

| Argument         | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doc`            | The document data for the current row                                                                                                  |
| `defaultURL`     | The default URL that Payload would normally generate for this document. You can return this as-is, modify it, or replace it entirely.  |
| `req`            | The full [PayloadRequest](../types/payload-request) object, providing access to user context, payload instance, and other request data |
| `collectionSlug` | The slug of the current collection                                                                                                     |
| `viewType`       | The current view context (`'list'`, `'trash'`, etc.) where the link is being generated                                                 |

The function should return:

- `null` to disable the link entirely (no link will be rendered)
- A `string` containing the custom URL to use for the link
- The `defaultURL` parameter to use Payload's default linking behavior

<Banner type="success">
  **Tip:** The `defaultURL` parameter saves you from having to reconstruct URLs
  manually. You can modify it by appending query parameters or use it as a
  fallback for your custom logic.
</Banner>

#### Examples

**Disable linking for certain users:**

```ts
formatDocURL: ({ defaultURL, req }) => {
  if (req.user?.role === 'editor') {
    return null // No link rendered
  }
  return defaultURL
}
```

## GraphQL

You can completely disable GraphQL for this collection by passing `graphQL: false` to your collection config. This will completely disable all queries, mutations, and types from appearing in your GraphQL schema.

You can also pass an object to the collection's `graphQL` property, which allows you to define the following properties:

| Option             | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `singularName`     | Override the "singular" name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.        |
| `pluralName`       | Override the "plural" name that will be used in GraphQL schema generation.          |
| `disableQueries`   | Disable all GraphQL queries that correspond to this collection by passing `true`.   |
| `disableMutations` | Disable all GraphQL mutations that correspond to this collection by passing `true`. |

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your Collection configs easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Collection Config, `CollectionConfig` and `SanitizedCollectionConfig`.

The `CollectionConfig` type represents a raw Collection Config in its full form, where only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedCollectionConfig` type represents a Collection Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig, SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'
```
