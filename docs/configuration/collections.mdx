A Collection is a group of records, called Documents, that all share a common schema. You can define as many Collections as your application needs. Each Document in a Collection is stored in the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates a [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) used to manage your Documents.

Collections are also used to achieve [Authentication](../authentication/overview) in Payload. By defining a Collection with `auth` options, that Collection receives additional operations to support user authentication.

Collections are the primary way to structure recurring data in your application, such as users, products, pages, posts, and other types of content that you might want to manage. Each Collection can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Collection Config, use the `collection` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [ // highlight-line
    // Your Collections go here
  ],
})
```

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  If your Collection is only ever meant to contain a single Document, consider using a [Global](./globals) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](../overview).

Here is what a simple Collection Config might look like:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
    }
  ]
}
```

The following options are available:

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Documents within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

[Collection Access Control](../access-control/overview) determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Document within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) documentation.

### Hooks

[Collection Hooks](../hooks/collections) allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

### Admin Options

You can customize the way that the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) behaves on a Collection-by-Collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Collection Admin Options](../admin/collections) documentation.

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your Collection configs easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Collection Config, `CollectionConfig` and `SanitizeCollectionConfig`.

The `CollectionConfig` type represents a raw Collection Config in its full form, where only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedCollectionConfig` type represents a Collection Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig, SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'
```
