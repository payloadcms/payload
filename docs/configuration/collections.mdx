Payload Collections are defined through configs of their own, and you can define as many as your application needs. Each
Collection will scaffold a new collection automatically in your database of choice, based on fields that you define.

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main Payload config.

## Options

| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

of [example collection configs](https://github.com/payloadcms/public-demo/tree/master/src/payload/collections) in the
Public
Demo source code on GitHub.

### Admin options

You can customize the way that the Admin panel behaves on a collection-by-collection basis by defining the `admin`
property on a collection's config.

| Option                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `forceRenderAllFields `      | Forces all fields in the Edit view to render immediately, regardless of scroll position. By default, this is set to `false` to improve performance, as fields are progressively rendered to balance load times.

| `hideAPIURL`                 | Hides the "API URL" meta field while editing documents within this collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `preview`                    | Function to generate preview URLS within the Admin panel that can point to your app. [More](#preview).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `livePreview`                | Enable real-time editing for instant visual feedback of your front-end application. [More](/docs/live-preview/overview).                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Preview

Collection `admin` options can accept a `preview` function that will be used to generate a link pointing to the frontend
of your app to preview data.

If the function is specified, a Preview button will automatically appear in the corresponding collection's Edit view.
Clicking the Preview button will link to the URL that is generated by the function.

**The preview function accepts two arguments:**

1. The document being edited
1. An `options` object, containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT.

**Example collection with preview function:**

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'slug',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  admin: {
    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {
      if (doc?.slug) {
        return `https://bigbird.com/preview/posts/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`
      }

      return null
    },
  },
}
```

### Pagination

Here are a few options that you can specify options for pagination on a collection-by-collection basis:

| Option         | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultLimit` | Integer that specifies the default per-page limit that should be used. Defaults to 10.              |
| `limits`       | Provide an array of integers to use as per-page options for admins to choose from in the List view. |

### Access control

You can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with documents in a collection) on a collection by
collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](/docs/access-control/overview) docs.

### Hooks

Hooks are a powerful way to extend collection functionality and execute your own logic, and can be defined on a
collection by collection basis. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](/docs/hooks/overview) documentation.

### Field types

Collections support all field types that Payload has to offer—including simple fields like text and checkboxes all the
way to more complicated layout-building field groups like Blocks. [Click here](/docs/fields/overview) to learn more
about field types.

### List Searchable Fields

In the List view, there is a "search" box that allows you to quickly find a document with a search. By default, it
searches on the ID field. If you have `admin.useAsTitle` defined, the list search will use that field. However, you can
define more than one field to search to make it easier on your admin editors to find the data they need.

For example, let's say you have a Posts collection with `title`, `metaDescription`, and `tags` fields - and you want all
three of those fields to be searchable in the List view. You can simply
add `admin.listSearchableFields: ['title', 'metaDescription', 'tags']` - and the admin UI will automatically search on
those three fields plus the ID field.

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note:**

If you are adding **listSearchableFields**, make sure you index each of these fields
so your admin queries can remain performant.

</Banner>

### Admin Hooks

In addition to collection hooks themselves, Payload provides for admin UI-specific hooks that you can leverage.

**`beforeDuplicate`**

The `beforeDuplicate` hook is an async function that accepts an object containing the data to duplicate, as well as the
locale of the doc to duplicate. Within this hook, you can modify the data to be duplicated, which is useful in cases
where you have unique fields that need to be incremented or similar, as well as if you want to automatically modify a
document's `title`.

Example:

```ts
import { BeforeDuplicate, CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
// Your auto-generated Page type
import { Page } from '../payload-types.ts'

const beforeDuplicate: BeforeDuplicate<Page> = ({ data }) => {
  return {
    ...data,
    title: `${data.title} Copy`,
    uniqueField: data.uniqueField ? `${data.uniqueField}-copy` : '',
  }
}

export const Page: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  admin: {
    hooks: {
      beforeDuplicate,
    },
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',

### TypeScript

You can import collection types as follows:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

// This is the type used for incoming collection configs.
// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.
```

```ts
import { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

// This is the type used after an incoming collection config is fully sanitized.
// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.
```
