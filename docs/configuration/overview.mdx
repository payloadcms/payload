Payload is a _config-based_, code-first CMS and application framework. The Payload Config is central to everything that Payload does, allowing for deep configuration of your application through a simple and intuitive API. The Payload Config is a fully-typed JavaScript object that can be infinitely extended upon.

Everything from your [Database](../database/overview) choice, to the appearance of the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), is fully controlled through the Payload Config. From here you can define [Fields](../fields/overview), add [Localization](./localization), enable [Authentication](../authentication/overview), configure [Access Control](../access-control/overview), and so much more.

The Payload Config is a `payload.config.ts` file typically located in the root of your project:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // Your config goes here
})
```

The Payload Config is strongly typed and ties directly into Payload's TypeScript codebase. This means your IDE (such as VSCode) will provide helpful information like type-ahead suggestions while you write your config.

## Config Options

To author your Payload Config, first determine which [Database](../database/overview) you'd like to use, then use [Collections](./collections) or [Globals](./globals) to define the schema of your data.

Here is one of the simplest possible Payload configs:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'
// import { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'

export default buildConfig({
  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'title',
          type: 'text'
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
})
```

### TypeScript

Payload exposes a variety of TypeScript settings that you can leverage. These settings are used to auto-generate TypeScript interfaces for your Collections and Globals, and to ensure that Payload uses your [Generated Types](../typescript/overview) for all Local API methods.

To customize the TypeScript settings, use the `typescript` property in your Payload Config:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  typescript: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  }
})
```

The following options are available:

| Option          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| **`autoGenerate`** | By default, Payload will auto-generate TypeScript interfaces for all collections and globals that your config defines. Opt out by setting `typescript.autoGenerate: false`. [More details](../typescript/overview). |
| **`declare`**     | By default, Payload adds a `declare` block to your generated types, which makes sure that Payload uses your generated types for all Local API methods. Opt out by setting `typescript.declare: false`. |
| **`outputFile`**  | Control the output path and filename of Payload's auto-generated types by defining the `typescript.outputFile` property to a full, absolute path. |

#### Importing Payload Config types

You can import config types as follows:

```ts
import { Config } from 'payload'

// This is the type used for an incoming Payload Config.
// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.
```

```ts
import { SanitizedConfig } from 'payload'

// This is the type used after an incoming Payload Config is fully sanitized.
// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.
```

## Config Location

For Payload command-line scripts, we need to be able to locate your Payload Config. We'll check a variety of locations for the presence of `payload.config.ts` by default, including the root current working directory, your `tsconfig`'s `rootDir`, and your `tsconfig`'s `outDir`.

In development mode, if the configuration file is not found at the root, Payload will attempt to read your `tsconfig.json`, and search in the directory specified in `compilerOptions.rootDir` (typically "src").

In production mode, Payload will first attempt to find the config file in the output directory specified in `compilerOptions.outDir` of your `tsconfig.json`, then fallback to the source directory (`compilerOptions.rootDir`), and finally will check the 'dist' directory.

Please ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured if you want Payload to accurately auto-detect your configuration file location. If `tsconfig.json` does not exist or doesn't specify `rootDir` or `outDir`, Payload will default to the current working directory.

### Customizing the Config Location

In addition to the above automated detection, you can specify your own location for the Payload Config. This is done by using the environment variable `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`. The path you provide via this environment variable can either be absolute or relative to your current working directory. This can be useful in situations where your Payload Config is not in a standard location, or you wish to switch between multiple configurations.

**Example in package.json:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "payload": "PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/custom-config.ts payload"
  }
}
```

When `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` is set, Payload will use this path to load the configuration, bypassing all automated detection.

## Telemetry

Payload collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. This data is super important to us and helps us accurately understand how we're growing and what we can do to build the software into everything that it can possibly be. The telemetry that we collect also help us demonstrate our growth in an accurate manner, which helps us as we seek investment to build and scale our team. If we can accurately demonstrate our growth, we can more effectively continue to support Payload as free and open-source software. To opt out of telemetry, you can pass `telemetry: false` within your Payload Config.
