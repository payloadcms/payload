Payload is a _config-based_, code-first CMS and application framework. The Payload Config is central to everything that Payload does, allowing for deep configuration of your application through a simple and intuitive API. The Payload Config is a fully-typed JavaScript object that can be infinitely extended upon.

Everything from your [Database](../database/overview) choice to the appearance of the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) is fully controlled through the Payload Config. From here you can define [Fields](../fields/overview), add [Localization](./localization), enable [Authentication](../authentication/overview), configure [Access Control](../access-control/overview), and so much more.

The Payload Config is a `payload.config.ts` file typically located in the root of your project:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // Your config goes here
})
```

The Payload Config is strongly typed and ties directly into Payload's TypeScript codebase. This means your IDE (such as VSCode) will provide helpful information like type-ahead suggestions while you write your config.

  **Tip:** The location of your Payload Config can be customized. [More
  details](#customizing-the-config-location).

## Config Options

To author your Payload Config, first determine which [Database](../database/overview) you'd like to use, then use [Collections](./collections) or [Globals](./globals) to define the schema of your data through [Fields](../fields/overview).

Here is one of the simplest possible Payload configs:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'

export default buildConfig({
  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET,
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'title',
          type: 'text',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note:** Some properties are removed from the client-side bundle. [More
  details](../custom-components/overview#accessing-the-payload-config).
</Banner>

### Typescript Config

Payload exposes a variety of TypeScript settings that you can leverage. These settings are used to auto-generate TypeScript interfaces for your [Collections](./collections) and [Globals](./globals), and to ensure that Payload uses your [Generated Types](../typescript/overview) for all [Local API](../local-api/overview) methods.

To customize the TypeScript settings, use the `typescript` property in your Payload Config:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  typescript: {
    // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
})
```

The following options are available:

| Option             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`autoGenerate`** | By default, Payload will auto-generate TypeScript interfaces for all collections and globals that your config defines. Opt out by setting `typescript.autoGenerate: false`. [More details](../typescript/overview). |
| **`declare`**      | By default, Payload adds a `declare` block to your generated types, which makes sure that Payload uses your generated types for all Local API methods. Opt out by setting `typescript.declare: false`.              |
| **`outputFile`**   | Control the output path and filename of Payload's auto-generated types by defining the `typescript.outputFile` property to a full, absolute path.                                                                   |

## Config Location

For Payload command-line scripts, we need to be able to locate your Payload Config. We'll check a variety of locations for the presence of `payload.config.ts` by default, including:

1. The root current working directory
1. The `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig`\*
1. The `dist` directory\*

_\* Config location detection is different between development and production environments. See below for more details._

<Banner type="warning">
  **Important:** Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly configured for Payload
  to auto-detect your config location. If it does not exist, or does not specify
  the proper `compilerOptions`, Payload will default to the current working
  directory.
</Banner>

**Development Mode**

In development mode, if the configuration file is not found at the root, Payload will attempt to read your `tsconfig.json`, and attempt to find the config file specified in the `rootDir`:

```json
{
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "src"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

**Production Mode**

In production mode, Payload will first attempt to find the config file in the `outDir` of your `tsconfig.json`, and if not found, will fallback to the `rootDir` directory:

```json
{
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

If none was in either location, Payload will finally check the `dist` directory.

### Customizing the Config Location

In addition to the above automated detection, you can specify your own location for the Payload Config. This can be useful in situations where your config is not in a standard location, or you wish to switch between multiple configurations. To do this, Payload exposes an [Environment Variable](../configuration/environment-vars) to bypass all automatic config detection.

To use a custom config location, set the `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "payload": "PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/custom-config.ts payload"
  }
}
```

<Banner type="info">
  **Tip:** `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` can be either an absolute path, or path
  relative to your current working directory.
</Banner>

## Telemetry

Payload collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. This data is super important to us and helps us accurately understand how we're growing and what we can do to build the software into everything that it can possibly be. The telemetry that we collect also help us demonstrate our growth in an accurate manner, which helps us as we seek investment to build and scale our team. If we can accurately demonstrate our growth, we can more effectively continue to support Payload as free and open-source software. To opt out of telemetry, you can pass `telemetry: false` within your Payload Config.

For more information about what we track, take a look at our [privacy policy](/privacy).

## Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)#cors

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) can be configured with either a whitelist array of URLS to allow CORS requests from, a wildcard string (`*`) to accept incoming requests from any domain, or a object with the following properties:

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`origins`** | Either a whitelist array of URLS to allow CORS requests from, or a wildcard string (`'*'`) to accept incoming requests from any domain. |
| **`headers`** | A list of allowed headers that will be appended in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.                                                      |

Here's an example showing how to allow incoming requests from any domain:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  cors: '*', // highlight-line
})
```

Here's an example showing how to append a new header (`x-custom-header`) in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  cors: {
    origins: ['http://localhost:3000'],
    headers: ['x-custom-header']
  }
  // highlight-end
})
```

## TypeScript

You can import types from Payload to help make writing your config easier and type-safe. There are two main types that represent the Payload Config, `Config` and `SanitizedConfig`.

The `Config` type represents a raw Payload Config in its full form. Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required. The `SanitizedConfig` type represents a Payload Config after it has been fully sanitized. Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.

```ts
import type { Config, SanitizedConfig } from 'payload'
```

## Server vs. Client

The Payload Config only lives on the server and is not allowed to contain any client-side code. That way, you can load up the Payload Config in any server environment or standalone script, without having to use Bundlers or Node.js loaders to handle importing client-only modules (e.g. scss files or React Components) without any errors.

Behind the curtains, the Next.js-based Admin Panel generates a ClientConfig, which strips away any server-only code and enriches the config with React Components.

## Compatibility flags

The Payload Config can accept compatibility flags for running the newest versions but with older databases. You should only use these flags if you need to, and should confirm that you need to prior to enabling these flags.

`allowLocalizedWithinLocalized`

Payload localization works on a field-by-field basis. As you can nest fields within other fields, you could potentially nest a localized field within a localized field—but this would be redundant and unnecessary. There would be no reason to define a localized field within a localized parent field, given that the entire data structure from the parent field onward would be localized.

By default, Payload will remove the `localized: true` property from sub-fields if a parent field is localized. Set this compatibility flag to `true` only if you have an existing Payload MongoDB database from pre-3.0, and you have nested localized fields that you would like to maintain without migrating.

## Custom bin scripts

Using the `bin` configuration property, you can inject your own scripts to `npx payload`.
Example for `pnpm payload seed`:

Step 1: create `seed.ts` file in the same folder with `payload.config.ts` with:

```ts
import type { SanitizedConfig } from 'payload'

import payload from 'payload'

// Script must define a "script" function export that accepts the sanitized config
export const script = async (config: SanitizedConfig) => {
  await payload.init({ config })
  await payload.create({
    collection: 'pages',
    data: { title: 'my title' },
  })
  payload.logger.info('Succesffully seeded!')
  process.exit(0)
}
```

Step 2: add the `seed` script to `bin`:

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  bin: [
    {
      scriptPath: path.resolve(dirname, 'seed.ts'),
      key: 'seed',
    },
  ],
})
```

Now you can run the command using:

```sh
pnpm payload seed
```
