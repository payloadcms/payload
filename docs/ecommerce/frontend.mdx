The `useCart` hook is used to manage the cart state and actions. It provides methods to add, remove, and update items in the cart, as well as to fetch the current cart state. It has the following properties:

| Property        | Type                                               | Description                                                                               |

  const { addItem, cart, clearCart, decrementItem, incrementItem, removeItem } =
    useCart()

  // Your component logic here
}
```

### useAddresses

The `useAddresses` hook is used to fetch and manage addresses. It provides methods to create, update, and delete addresses, as well as to fetch the list of addresses. It has the following properties:

| Property        | Type                                                              | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `updateAddress` | `(addressID: IDType, data: Partial<Address>) => Promise<Address>` | Method to update an existing address by ID.                       |

Example usage:

```tsx
import { useAddresses } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce/client/react'

const AddressesComponent = () => {
  const { addresses, createAddress, updateAddress } = useAddresses()

  // Your component logic here
}
```

### usePayments

The `usePayments` hook is used to manage the checkout process. It provides methods to initiate payments, confirm orders, and handle payment status. It has the following properties:

| Property                | Type                       | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `confirmOrder`          | `(args) => Promise<Order>` | Method to confirm an order by ID. [More](#confirmOrder)             |
| `initiatePayment`       | `(args) => Promise<void>`  | Method to initiate a payment for an order. [More](#initiatePayment) |
| `paymentMethods`        | `PaymentMethod[]`          | The list of available payment methods.                              |
| `selectedPaymentMethod` | `PaymentMethod`            | The currently selected payment method, if any.                      |

Example usage:

```tsx
import { usePayments } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce/client/react'

const CheckoutComponent = () => {
  const {
    confirmOrder,
    initiatePayment,
    paymentMethods,
    selectedPaymentMethod,
  } = usePayments()

  // Your component logic here
}
```

#### confirmOrder

Use this method to confirm an order by its ID. It requires the payment method ID and will return the order ID.

```ts
try {
  const data = await confirmOrder('stripe', {
    additionalData: {
      paymentIntentID: paymentIntent.id,
      customerEmail,
    },
  })
  // Return type will contain `orderID`
  // use data to redirect to your order page
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

If the payment gateway requires additional confirmations offsite then you will need another landing page to handle that. For example with Stripe you may need to use a callback URL, just make sure the relevant information is routed back.

<Banner type="info">
  This will mark the transaction as complete in the backend and create the order
  for the user.
</Banner>

#### initiatePayment

Use this method to initiate a payment for an order. It requires the cart ID and the payment method ID. Depending on the payment method, additional data may be required. Depending on the payment method used you may need to provide additional data, for example with Stripe:

```ts
try {
  const data = await initiatePayment('stripe', {
    additionalData: {
      customerEmail,
      billingAddress,
      shippingAddress,
    },
  })
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

This function will hit the Payload API endpoint for `/stripe/initiate` and return the payment data required to complete the payment on the client side, which by default will include a `client_secret` to complete the payment with Stripe.js. The next step is to call the `confirmOrder` once payment is confirmed on the client side by Stripe.

<Banner type="info">
  At this step the cart is verified and a transaction is created in the backend
  with the address details provided. No order is created yet until you call
  `confirmOrder`, which should be done after payment is confirmed on the client
  side or via webhooks if you opt for that approach instead.
</Banner>

### useCurrency

The `useCurrency` hook is used to format prices based on the selected currency. It provides methods to format prices and to get the current currency. It has the following properties:

| Property           | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `currenciesConfig` | `CurrenciesConfig`               | The configuration for supported currencies. Directly matching the config provided to the Context Provider. [More](#ecommerceprovider) |
| `currency`         | `Currency`                       | The currently selected currency.                                                                                                      |
| `formatPrice`      | `(amount: number) => string`     | Method to format a price based on the selected currency.                                                                              |
| `setCurrency`      | `(currencyCode: string) => void` | Method to set the current currency by code. It will update all price formats when used in conjunction with the `formatPrice` utility. |

`formatPrice` in particular is very helpful as all prices are stored as integers to avoid any potential issues with decimal calculations, therefore on the frontend you can use this utility to format your price accounting for the currency and decimals. Example usage:

```tsx
import { useCurrency } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce/client/react'

const PriceComponent = ({ amount }) => {
  const { currenciesConfig, currency, setCurrency } = useCurrency()

  return <div>{formatPrice(amount)}</div>
}
```

### useEcommerce

The `useEcommerce` hook encompasses all of the above hooks in one. It provides access to the cart, addresses, and payments hooks.

Example usage:

```tsx
import { useEcommerce } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce/client/react'

const EcommerceComponent = () => {
  const { cart, addresses, selectedPaymentMethod } = useEcommerce()

  // Your component logic here
}
```
