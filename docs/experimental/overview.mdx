Experimental features allow you to try out new functionality before it becomes a stable part of Payload. These features may still be in active development, may have incomplete functionality, and can change or be removed in future releases without warning.

## How It Works

Experimental features are configured via the root-level `experimental` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview). This property contains individual feature flags, each flag can be configured independently, allowing you to selectively opt into specific functionality.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  experimental: {
    localizeStatus: true, // highlight-line
  },
})
```

## Experimental Options

The following options are available:

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`localizeStatus`** | **Boolean.** When `true`, shows document status per locale in the admin panel instead of always showing the latest overall status. Opt-in for backwards compatibility. Defaults to `false`. |

This list may change without notice.

## When to Use Experimental Features

You might enable an experimental feature when:

- You want early access to new capabilities before their stable release.
- You can accept the risks of using potentially unstable functionality.
- You are testing new features in a development or staging environment.
- You wish to provide feedback to the Payload team on new functionality.

If you are working on a production application, carefully evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the risks. For most stable applications, it is recommended to wait until the feature is officially released.
