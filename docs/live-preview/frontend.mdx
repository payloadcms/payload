There are two ways to use Live Preview in your own application depending on whether your front-end framework supports Server Components:

- [Server-side Live Preview (suggested)](./server)
- [Client-side Live Preview](./client)

  We suggest using server-side Live Preview if your framework supports Server
  Components, it is both simpler to setup and more performant to run than the
  client-side alternative.
