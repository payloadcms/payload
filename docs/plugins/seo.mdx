This plugin allows you to easily manage SEO metadata for your application from within your [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). When enabled on your [Collections](../configuration/collections) and [Globals](../configuration/globals), it adds a new `meta` field group containing `title`, `description`, and `image` by default. Your front-end application can then use this data to render meta tags however your application requires. For example, you would inject a `title` tag into the `<head>` of your page using `meta.title` as its content.

As users are editing documents within the Admin Panel, they have the option to "auto-generate" these fields. When clicked, this plugin will execute your own custom functions that re-generate the title, description, and image. This way you can build your own SEO writing assistance directly into your application. For example, you could append your site name onto the page title, or use the document's excerpt field as the description, or even integrate with some third-party API to generate the image using AI.

To help you visualize what your page might look like in a search engine, a preview is rendered on page just beneath the meta fields. This preview is updated in real-time as you edit your metadata. There are also visual indicators to help you write effective meta, such as a character counter for the title and description fields. You can even inject your own custom fields into the `meta` field group as your application requires, like `og:title` or `json-ld`. If you've ever used something like Yoast SEO, this plugin might feel very familiar.

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
  pnpm add @payloadcms/plugin-seo
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload';
import { seoPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo';

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: []
    },
    {
      slug: 'media',
      upload: {
        staticDir: // path to your static directory,
      },
      fields: []
    }
  ],
  plugins: [
    seoPlugin({
      collections: [
        'pages',
      ],
      uploadsCollection: 'media',
      generateTitle: ({ doc }) => `Website.com — ${doc.title}`,
      generateDescription: ({ doc }) => doc.excerpt
    })
  ]
});

export default config;
```

### Options

##### `collections`

An array of collections slugs to enable SEO. Enabled collections receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.

##### `globals`

An array of global slugs to enable SEO. Enabled globals receive a `meta` field which is an object of title, description, and image subfields.

##### `fields`

An array of fields that allows you to inject your own custom fields onto the `meta` field group. The following fields are provided by default:

- `title`: text
- `description`: textarea
- `image`: upload (if an `uploadsCollection` is provided)
- `preview`: ui

##### `uploadsCollection`

Set the `uploadsCollection` to your application's upload-enabled collection slug. This is used to provide an `image` field on the `meta` field group.

##### `tabbedUI`

When the `tabbedUI` property is `true`, it appends an `SEO` tab onto your config using Payload's [Tabs Field](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/tabs). If your collection is not already tab-enabled, meaning the first field in your config is not of type `tabs`, then one will be created for you called `Content`. Defaults to `false`.

<Banner type="info">
  If you wish to continue to use top-level or sidebar fields with `tabbedUI`, you must not let the
  default `Content` tab get created for you (see the note above). Instead, you must define the first
  field of your config with type `tabs` and place all other fields adjacent to this one.

##### `generateTitle`

A function that allows you to return any meta title, including from document's content.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  seoPlugin({
    generateTitle: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale, req }) => `Website.com — ${doc?.title}`,
  })
}
```

##### `generateDescription`

A function that allows you to return any meta description, including from document's content.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  seoPlugin({
    generateDescription: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale, req }) => doc?.excerpt,
  })
}
```

##### `generateImage`

A function that allows you to return any meta image, including from document's content.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  seoPlugin({
    generateImage: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale, req }) => doc?.featuredImage,
  })
}
```

##### `generateURL`

A function called by the search preview component to display the actual URL of your page.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  seoPlugin({
    generateURL: ({ ...docInfo, doc, locale, req }) =>
      `https://yoursite.com/${collection?.slug}/${doc?.slug}`,
  })
}
```

#### `interfaceName`

Rename the meta group interface name that is generated for TypeScript and GraphQL.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  seoPlugin({
    interfaceName: 'customInterfaceNameSEO',
  })
}
```

#### `fieldOverrides`

Pass any valid field props to the base fields: Title, Description or Image.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
seoPlugin({
  // ...
  fieldOverrides: {
    title: {
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      localized: true,
    },
  },
})
```

## Direct use of fields

There is the option to directly import any of the fields from the plugin so that you can include them anywhere as needed.

<Banner type="info">
  You will still need to configure the plugin in the Payload Config in order to configure the generation functions.
  Since these fields are imported and used directly, they don't have access to the plugin config so they may need additional arguments to work the same way.
</Banner>

```ts
import { MetaDescriptionField, MetaImageField, MetaTitleField, OverviewField, PreviewField } from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/fields'

// Used as fields
MetaImageField({
  // the upload collection slug
  relationTo: 'media',

  // if the `generateImage` function is configured
  hasGenerateFn: true,
})

MetaDescriptionField({
  // if the `generateDescription` function is configured
  hasGenerateFn: true,
})

MetaTitleField({
  // if the `generateTitle` function is configured
  hasGenerateFn: true,
})

PreviewField({
  // if the `generateUrl` function is configured
  hasGenerateFn: true,

  // field paths to match the target field for data
  titlePath: 'meta.title',
  descriptionPath: 'meta.description',
})

OverviewField({
  // field paths to match the target field for data
  titlePath: 'meta.title',
  descriptionPath: 'meta.description',
  imagePath: 'meta.image',
})
```

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import {
  PluginConfig,
  GenerateTitle,
  GenerateDescription
  GenerateURL
} from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/types';
```

You can then pass the collections from your generated Payload types into the generation types, for example:

```ts
import { Page } from './payload-types.ts';

import { GenerateTitle } from '@payloadcms/plugin-seo/types';

const generateTitle: GenerateTitle<Page> = async ({ doc, locale }) => {
  return `Website.com — ${doc?.title}`
}
```

## Examples

The [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) contains an official [Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website) and [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommere) which demonstrates exactly how to configure this plugin in Payload and implement it on your front-end.
