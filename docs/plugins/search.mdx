[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@payloadcms/plugin-search)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-search)

This plugin generates records of your documents that are extremely fast to search on. It does so by creating a new `search` collection that is indexed in the database using only search-critical data that you define. Records are automatically created, synced, and deleted behind-the-scenes as you manage your application's documents.

You can then use all the normal Payload APIs like to query search results just as you would any other document. You can even prioritize search results by defining a custom priority for each collection. For example, you may want to prioritize blog posts over pages. Or you may want one specific post to always take precedence.

This is a great way to implement a fast, immersive search experience for something like a search bar in a front-end application. Many applications may not need the power and complexity of a third-party service like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This plugin provides a first-party alternative that is easy to set up and runs entirely on your own database.

##### Core Features

- Automatically adds an indexed `search` collection to your database
- Automatically creates, syncs, and deletes search records as you manage your documents
- Saves only search-critical data that you define (e.g. title, excerpt, etc.)
- Allows you to query search results using first-party Payload APIs
- Allows you to easily prioritize search results

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-search
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):

```js
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import search from '@payloadcms/plugin-search'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: [],
    },
    {
      slug: 'posts',
      fields: [],
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    search({
      collections: ['pages', 'posts'],
      defaultPriorities: {
        pages: 10,
        posts: 20,
      },
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

### Options

#### `collections`

The `collections` property is an array of collections slugs to enable syncing to search. Enabled collections receive a `beforeChange` and `afterDelete` hook that creates, updates, and deletes the record as its related document changes over time.

#### `defaultPriorities`

The `defaultPriorities` property is used to set a fallback `priority` on search records during the `create` operation. Send an object of collection slugs, and set them to either a number or a function.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    defaultPriorities: {
      pages: ({ doc }) => (doc.title.startsWith('Hello, world!') ? 1 : 10),
      posts: 20,
    },
    // ...
    // See below for all options
  }),
}
```

#### `searchOverrides`

Use the `searchOverrides` property to override anything on the search collection. You can override any of the properties found in the [Payload Collection Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections).

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    searchOverrides: {
      slug: 'search-results',
    },
  }),
}
```

#### `beforeSync`

The `beforeSync` property is an [afterChange](<[afterChange](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/globals#afterchange)>) hook that is called before creating or syncing the document to search. This allows you to modify the data in any way before its search record is created or updated.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    beforeSync: ({ originalDoc, searchDoc }) => ({
      ...searchDoc,
      // Modify your docs in any way here, this can be async
      excerpt: originalDoc?.excerpt || 'This is a fallback excerpt',
    }),
  }),
}
```

#### `syncDrafts`

When `syncDrafts` is true, draft documents will be synced to search. This is false by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.

#### `deleteDrafts`

If true, will delete documents from search whose status changes to draft. This is true by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import { SearchConfig, BeforeSync } from '@payloadcms/plugin-search/dist/types'
```
