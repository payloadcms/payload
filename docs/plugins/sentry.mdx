### What is Sentry?

Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool that helps developers identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in their applications.

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-sentry
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin and pass in your Sentry DSN as an option.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { sentry } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
import { Pages, Media } from './collections'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [Pages, Media],
  plugins: [
    sentry({
      dsn: 'https://61edebas776889984d323d777@o4505289711681536.ingest.sentry.io/4505357433352176',
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## Options

- `dsn` : string | **required**

  Sentry automatically assigns a DSN when you create a project, the unique DSN informs Sentry where to send events so they are associated with the correct project.

<Banner type="warning">
  You can find your project DSN (Data Source Name) by visiting [sentry.io](sentry.io) and navigating to your [Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN).
</Banner>

- `enabled`: boolean | optional

  Set to false to disable the plugin. Defaults to true.

- `init` : ClientOptions | optional

  Sentry allows a variety of options to be passed into the Sentry.init() function, see the full list of options [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/guides/express/configuration/options).

- `requestHandler` : RequestHandlerOptions | optional

  Accepts options that let you decide what data should be included in the event sent to Sentry, checkout the options [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/guides/express/configuration/options).

- `captureErrors`: number[] | optional

  By default, `Sentry.errorHandler` will capture only errors with a status code of 500 or higher. To capture additional error codes, pass the values as numbers in an array.

To see all options available, visit the [Sentry Docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/guides/express/configuration/options).

### Example

Configure any of these options by passing them to the plugin:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { sentry } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
import { Pages, Media } from './collections'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [Pages, Media],
  plugins: [
    sentry({
      dsn: 'https://61edebas777689984d323d777@o4505289711681536.ingest.sentry.io/4505357433352176',
      options: {
        init: {
          debug: true,
          environment: 'development',
          tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
        },
        requestHandler: {
          serverName: false,
          user: ['email'],
        },
        captureErrors: [400, 403, 404],
      },
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import { PluginOptions } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry/types'
```
