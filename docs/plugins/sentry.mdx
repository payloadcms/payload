This plugin allows you to integrate [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) seamlessly with your [Payload](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) application.

## What is Sentry?

Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool that helps developers identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in their applications.

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [npm](https://npmjs.com), or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
  pnpm add @payloadcms/plugin-sentry
```

## Sentry for Next.js setup

This plugin requires to complete the [Sentry + Next.js setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) before.

You can use either the [automatic setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#install) with the installation wizard:

```sh
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

Or the [Manual Setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/)

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin and pass in your Sentry DSN as an option.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { sentryPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
import { Pages, Media } from './collections'

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [Pages, Media],
  plugins: [
    sentryPlugin({
      Sentry,
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## Options

- `Sentry` : Sentry | **required**

  The `Sentry` instance

<Banner type="warning">
  Make sure to complete the [Sentry for Next.js Setup](#sentry-for-nextjs-setup)
  before.
</Banner>

- `enabled`: boolean | optional

  Set to false to disable the plugin. Defaults to `true`.

- `context`: `(args: ContextArgs) => Partial<ScopeContext> | Promise<Partial<ScopeContext>>`

  Pass additional [contextual data](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/#passing-context-directly) to Sentry

- `captureErrors`: number[] | optional

  By default, `Sentry.errorHandler` will capture only errors with a status code of 500 or higher. To capture additional error codes, pass the values as numbers in an array.

### Example

Configure any of these options by passing them to the plugin:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { sentryPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'

import { Pages, Media } from './collections'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [Pages, Media],
  plugins: [
    sentryPlugin({
      options: {
        captureErrors: [400, 403],
        context: ({ defaultContext, req }) => {
          return {
            ...defaultContext,
            tags: {
              locale: req.locale,
            },
          }
        },
        debug: true,
      },
      Sentry,
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import { PluginOptions } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
```
