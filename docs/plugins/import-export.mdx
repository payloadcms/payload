<Banner type="warning">
  **Note**: This plugin is in **beta** as some aspects of it may change on any
  minor releases. It is under development and currently only supports exporting
  of collection data.
</Banner>

This plugin adds features that give admin users the ability to download or create export data as an upload collection and import it back into a project.

## Core Features

- Export data as CSV or JSON format via the admin UI
- Download the export directly through the browser
- Create a file upload of the export data
- Use the jobs queue for large exports
- (Coming soon) Import collection data

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [npm](https://npmjs.com), or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
pnpm add @payloadcms/plugin-import-export
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { importExportPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-import-export'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [Pages, Media],
  plugins: [
    importExportPlugin({
      collections: ['users', 'pages'],
      // see below for a list of available options
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## Options

| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `collections`              | string[] | Collections to include Import/Export controls in. Defaults to all collections.                                                       |

| `format`                   | string   | Forces a specific export format (`csv` or `json`), hides the format dropdown, and prevents the user from choosing the export format. |
| `overrideExportCollection` | function | Function to override the default export collection; takes the default export collection and allows you to modify and return it.      |

## Field Options

In addition to the above plugin configuration options, you can granularly set the following field level options using the `custom['plugin-import-export']` properties in any of your collections.

| Property   | Type     | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled` | boolean  | When `true` the field is completely excluded from the import-export plugin.                                                   |
| `toCSV`    | function | Custom function used to modify the outgoing csv data by manipulating the data, siblingData or by returning the desired value. |

### Customizing the output of CSV data

To manipulate the data that a field exports you can add `toCSV` custom functions. This allows you to modify the outgoing csv data by manipulating the data, siblingData or by returning the desired value.

The toCSV function argument is an object with the following properties:

| Property     | Type    | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `columnName` | string  | The CSV column name given to the field.                           |
| `doc`        | object  | The top level document                                            |
| `row`        | object  | The object data that can be manipulated to assign data to the CSV |
| `siblingDoc` | object  | The document data at the level where it belongs                   |
| `value`      | unknown | The data for the field.                                           |

Example function:

```ts
const pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'author',
      type: 'relationship',
      relationTo: 'users',
      custom: {
        'plugin-import-export': {
          toCSV: ({ value, columnName, row }) => {
            // add both `author_id` and the `author_email` to the csv export
            if (
              value &&
              typeof value === 'object' &&
              'id' in value &&
              'email' in value
            ) {
              row[`${columnName}_id`] = (value as { id: number | string }).id
              row[`${columnName}_email`] = (value as { email: string }).email
            }
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Exporting Data

There are four possible ways that the plugin allows for exporting documents, the first two are available in the admin UI from the list view of a collection:

1. Direct download - Using a `POST` to `/api/exports/download` and streams the response as a file download
2. File storage - Goes to the `exports` collection as an uploads enabled collection
3. Local API - A create call to the uploads collection: `payload.create({ slug: 'uploads', ...parameters })`
4. Jobs Queue - `payload.jobs.queue({ task: 'createCollectionExport', input: parameters })`

By default, a user can use the Export drawer to create a file download by choosing `Save` or stream a downloadable file directly without persisting it by using the `Download` button. Either option can be disabled to provide the export experience you desire for your use-case.

The UI for creating exports provides options so that users can be selective about which documents to include and also which columns or fields to include.

It is necessary to add access control to the uploads collection configuration using the `overrideExportCollection` function if you have enabled this plugin on collections with data that some authenticated users should not have access to.

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note**: Users who have read access to the upload collection may be able to
  download data that is normally not readable due to [access
  control](../access-control/overview).

The following parameters are used by the export function to handle requests:

| `limit`          | number   | The max number of documents to return                                                                             |

| `collectionSlug` | string   | The slug to query against                                                                                         |
| `where`          | object   | The WhereObject used to query documents to export. This is set by making selections or filters from the list view |
| `filename`       | text     | What to call the export being created                                                                             |
