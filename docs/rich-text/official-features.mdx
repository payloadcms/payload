      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

#### Code Blocks

Payload exports a premade CodeBlock that you can import and use in your project. It supports syntax highlighting, dynamically selecting the language and loading in external type definitions:

```ts
import { BlocksFeature, CodeBlock } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

// ...
BlocksFeature({
  blocks: [
    CodeBlock({
      defaultLanguage: 'ts',
      languages: {
        js: 'JavaScript',
        plaintext: 'Plain Text',
        ts: 'TypeScript',
      },
    }),
  ],
}),
// ...
```

When using TypeScript, you can also pass in additional type definitions that will be available in the editor. Here's an example of how to make `payload` and `react` available in the editor:

```ts
import { BlocksFeature, CodeBlock } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

// ...
BlocksFeature({
  blocks: [
    CodeBlock({
      slug: 'PayloadCode',
      languages: {
        ts: 'TypeScript',
      },
      typescript: {
        fetchTypes: [
          {
            // The index.bundled.d.ts contains all the types for Payload in one file, so that Monaco doesn't need to fetch multiple files.
            // This file may be removed in the future and is not guaranteed to be available in future versions of Payload.
            url: 'https://unpkg.com/payload@3.59.0-internal.8435f3c/dist/index.bundled.d.ts',
            filePath: 'file:///node_modules/payload/index.d.ts',
          },
          {

- Included by default: No
- Types:

```ts
type TextStateFeatureProps = {
  /**
   * The keys of the top-level object (stateKeys) represent the attributes that the textNode can have (e.g., color).
   * The values of the top-level object (stateValues) represent the values that the attribute can have (e.g., red, blue, etc.).
   * Within the stateValue, you can define inline styles and labels.
   */
  state: { [stateKey: string]: StateValues }
}

type StateValues = {
  [stateValue: string]: {
    css: StyleObject
    label: string
  }
}

type StyleObject = {
  [K in keyof PropertiesHyphenFallback]?:
    | Extract<PropertiesHyphenFallback[K], string>
    | undefined
}
```

- Usage example:

```ts
// We offer default colors that have good contrast and look good in dark and light mode.
import { defaultColors, TextStateFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

TextStateFeature({
  // prettier-ignore
  state: {
    color: {
      ...defaultColors,
      // fancy gradients!
      galaxy: { label: 'Galaxy', css: { background: 'linear-gradient(to right, #0000ff, #ff0000)', color: 'white' } },
      sunset: { label: 'Sunset', css: { background: 'linear-gradient(to top, #ff5f6d, #6a3093)' } },
    },
    // You can have both colored and underlined text at the same time.
    // If you don't want that, you should group them within the same key.
    // (just like I did with defaultColors and my fancy gradients)
    underline: {
      'solid': { label: 'Solid', css: { 'text-decoration': 'underline', 'text-underline-offset': '4px' } },
       // You'll probably want to use the CSS light-dark() utility.
      'yellow-dashed': { label: 'Yellow Dashed', css: { 'text-decoration': 'underline dashed', 'text-decoration-color': 'light-dark(#EAB308,yellow)', 'text-underline-offset': '4px' } },
    },
  },
}),
```
