## Migrating from Slate

While both Slate and Lexical save the editor state in JSON, the structure of the JSON is different.

First, make sure you add the `SlateToLexicalFeature` to every richText field you want to migrate. By default, every time the data is accessed, this feature will convert your data from the slate to lexical format on-the-fly through an `afterRead` hook. If the data is already in lexical format, it will just pass it through.

This means you can use this feature to "preview" the migration result in the Admin Panel, without having to run the migration script. Keep in mind that saving the document from the Admin Panel will override the slate data with the lexical data in the database, so don't do that if you did not verify the migration result.

**Example:**

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

import { SlateToLexicalFeature } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/migrate'
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',
      type: 'richText',
      editor: lexicalEditor({
        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [
          ...defaultFeatures,
          SlateToLexicalFeature({}),
        ],
      }),
    },
  ],
}
```

Each richText editor will have their own `SlateToLexicalFeature` instance, because each richText field may need different converters. For example, you might have a richText field that contains a custom Slate node, and you need to create a custom converter for it.

### Running the Migration Script

Once you've added the `SlateToLexicalFeature` to every richText field you want to migrate and are happy with the result, you can run the migration script.

It's recommended to run the migration script instead of just using the `SlateToLexicalFeature` for the following reasons:

- There is a performance hit when using the `SlateToLexicalFeature` as it has to convert the data on-the-fly every time the data is accessed.
- You will still receive Slate data when using direct DB operations (e.g. `payload.db.find` instead of `payload.find`).

Just import the `migrateSlateToLexical` function we provide, pass it the `payload` object and run it. Depending on the amount of collections, this might take a while.

**IMPORTANT: This will overwrite all slate data. We recommend doing the following first:**

1. Take a backup of your entire database. If anything goes wrong and you do not have a backup, you are on your own and will not receive any support.
2. Convert every richText field to a lexical editor. This script will only convert lexical richText fields with old Slate data.
3. Add the `SlateToLexicalFeature` (as explained aboce) first, and test it out by loading up the Admin Panel, to see if the migrator works as expected. You might have to build some custom converters for some fields first in order to convert custom Slate nodes. The `SlateToLexicalFeature` is where the converters are stored - the migration script will access those converters through that feature. Thus, only fields with this feature added will be migrated.
4. If this works as expected, add the `disableHooks: true` prop everywhere you're initializing `SlateToLexicalFeature`. Example: `SlateToLexicalFeature({ disableHooks: true })`. Once you did that, you're ready to run the migration script.

```ts
import { migrateSlateToLexical } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/migrate'

await migrateSlateToLexical({ payload })
```

### Converting custom Slate nodes

If you have custom Slate nodes, create a custom converter for them. Here's the Upload converter as an example:

```ts
import type { SerializedUploadNode } from '../uploadNode'
import type { SlateNodeConverter } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export const SlateUploadConverter: SlateNodeConverter = {
  converter({ slateNode }) {
    return {
      fields: {
        ...slateNode.fields,
      },
      format: '',
      relationTo: slateNode.relationTo,
      type: 'upload',
      value: {
        id: slateNode.value?.id || '',
      },
      version: 1,
    } as const as SerializedUploadNode
  },
  nodeTypes: ['upload'],
}
```

It's pretty simple: You get a Slate node as input, and you return the lexical node. The `nodeTypes` array is used to determine which Slate nodes this converter can handle.

You can add your custom converters to the `converters` property of the `SlateToLexicalFeature` props:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
import {
  SlateToLexicalFeature,
  defaultSlateConverters,
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

import { YourCustomConverter } from '../converters/YourCustomConverter'

const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',
      type: 'richText',
      editor: lexicalEditor({
        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [
          ...defaultFeatures,
          SlateToLexicalFeature({
            converters: [...defaultSlateConverters, YourCustomConverter],
          }),
        ],
      }),
    },
  ],
}
```

<Bannner type="info">
  The migration script automatically traverses all collections and fields, pulls in the converters from the `SlateToLexicalFeature` and converts the data by calling `convertSlateToLexical`.

If you're manually calling `convertSlateToLexical`, you can pass in the converters to the `converters` property.

## Migrating lexical data from old version to new version

Each lexical node has a `version` property which is saved in the database. Every time we make a breaking change to the node's data, we increment the version. This way, we can detect an old version and automatically convert old data to the new format once you open up the editor.

The problem is, this migration only happens when you open the editor, modify the richText field (so that the field's `setValue` function is called) and save the document. Until you do that for all documents, some documents will still have the old data.

To solve this, we export an `upgradeLexicalData` function which goes through every single document in your Payload app and re-saves it, if it has a lexical editor. This way, the data is automatically converted to the new format, and that automatic conversion gets applied to every single document in your app.

IMPORTANT: Take a backup of your entire database. If anything goes wrong and you do not have a backup, you are on your own and will not receive any support.

```ts
import { upgradeLexicalData } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

await upgradeLexicalData({ payload })
```

## Migrating from payload-plugin-lexical

Migrating from [payload-plugin-lexical](https://github.com/AlessioGr/payload-plugin-lexical) works similar to migrating from Slate.

Instead of a `SlateToLexicalFeature` there is a `LexicalPluginToLexicalFeature` you can use. And instead of `convertSlateToLexical` you can use `convertLexicalPluginToLexical`.
