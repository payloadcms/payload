desc: Bundlers are used to bundle the code that serves Payload's Admin Panel.

Payload has two official bundlers, the [Webpack Bundler](/docs/admin/webpack) and the [Vite Bundler](/docs/admin/vite). You must install a bundler to use the admin panel.

##### Install a bundler

Webpack (recommended):

```text
yarn add @payloadcms/bundler-webpack
```

Vite (beta):

```text
yarn add @payloadcms/bundler-vite
```

##### Configure the bundler

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'
// import { viteBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-vite'

export default buildConfig({
  // highlight-start
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler() // or viteBundler()
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

### What are bundlers?

At their core, a bundler's main goal is to take a bunch of files and turn them into a few optimized files that you ship to the browser. The admin UI has a root `index.html` entry point, and from there the bundler traverses the dependency tree, bundling all of the files that are required from that point on.

Since the bundled file is sent to the browser, it can't include any server-only code. You will need to remove any server-only code from your admin UI before bundling it. You can learn more about [excluding server code](/docs/admin/excluding-server-code) section.

  <strong>Using environment variables in the admin UI</strong>
  <br />
  Bundles should not contain sensitive information. By default, Payload
  excludes env variables from the bundle. If you need to use env variables in your payload config,
  you need to prefix them with `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_` to make them available to the client-side code.
