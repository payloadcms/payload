Payload has a Webpack (v5) bundler that you can build the Admin panel with. For now, we recommended using it because it is stable. If you are feeling a bit more adventurous you can give the [Vite](/docs/admin/vite) bundler a shot.

Out of the box, the Webpack bundler supports common functionalities such as SCSS and Typescript, but there are many cases where you may need to add support for additional functionalities.

#### Installation

```bash
yarn add @payloadcms/bundler-webpack
```

#### Import the bundler

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

export default buildConfig({
  // highlight-start
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler()
  },
  // highlight-end
})
```

### Extending Webpack

If you need to extend the Webpack config, you can do so by passing a function to the `admin.webpack` property on your Payload config.
The function will receive the Webpack config as an argument and should return the modified config.

```ts
// payload.config.ts

import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { webpackBundler } from '@payloadcms/bundler-webpack'

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler()
    // highlight-start
    webpack: (config) => {
      // full control of the Webpack config

      return config
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
})
```

  **Tip:**

  If changes to your Webpack aliases are not surfacing, they might be
  [cached](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/) in `node_modules/.cache/webpack`. Try
  deleting that folder and restarting your server.
