The Payload [Admin Panel](./overview) is designed to be as minimal and straightforward as possible to allow for easy customization and full control over the UI. In order for Payload to support this level of customization, Payload provides a pattern for you to supply your own React components through your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview).

All Custom Components in Payload are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. This enables the use of the [Local API](../local-api/overview) directly on the front-end. Custom Components are available for nearly every part of the Admin Panel for extreme granularity and control.

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  Client Components continue to be fully supported. To use Client Components in your app, simply include the `use client` directive. Payload will automatically detect and remove all default, [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) before rendering your component. [More details](#client-components).
</Banner>

There are four main types of Custom Components in Payload:

- [Root Components](#root-components)
- [Collection Components](./collections#custom-components)
- [Global Components](./globals#custom-components)
- [Field Components](./fields#custom-components)

To swap in your own Custom Component, first consult the list of available components, determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, then [author your React component(s)](#building-custom-components) accordingly.

## Defining Custom Components

As Payload compiles the Admin Panel, it checks your config for Custom Components. When detected, Payload either replaces its own default component with yours, or if none exists by default, renders yours outright. While are many places where Custom Components are supported in Payload, each is defined in the same way using [Component Paths](#component-paths).

To add a Custom Component, point to its file path in your Payload Config:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      logout: {
        Button: '/src/components/Logout#MyComponent' // highlight-line
      }
    }
  },
})
```

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  All Custom Components can be either Server Components or Client Components, depending on the presence of the `use client` directive at the top of the file.
</Banner>

### Component Paths

In order to ensure the Payload Config is fully Node.js compatible and as lightweight as possible, components are not directly imported into your config. Instead, they are identified by their file path for the Admin Panel to resolve on its own.

Component Paths, by default, are relative to your project's base directory. This is either your current working directory, or the directory specified in `config.admin.baseDir`. To simplify Component Paths, you can also configure the base directory using the `admin.importMap.baseDir` property.

Components using named exports are identified either by appending `#` followed by the export name, or using the `exportName` property. If the component is the default export, this can be omitted.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import path from 'path'
const filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const dirname = path.dirname(filename)

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    importMap: {
      baseDir: path.resolve(dirname, 'src'), // highlight-line
    },
    components: {
      logout: {
        Button: '/components/Logout#MyComponent' // highlight-line
      }
    }
  },
})
```

In this example, we set the base directory to the `src` directory, and omit the `/src/` part of our component path string.

### Config Options

While Custom Components are usually defined as a string, you can also pass in an object with additional options:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      logout: {
        // highlight-start
        Button: {
          path: '/src/components/Logout',
          exportName: 'MyComponent',
        }
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  },
})
```

The following options are available:

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`clientProps`** | Props to be passed to the Custom Components if it's a Client Component. [More details](#custom-props).                         |
| **`exportName`**  | Instead of declaring named exports using `#` in the component path, you can also omit them from `path` and pass them in here. |
| **`path`**        | File path to the Custom Component. Named exports can be appended to the end of the path, separated by a `#`.                         |
| **`serverProps`** | Props to be passed to the Custom Component if it's a Server Component. [More details](#custom-props).                         |

For more details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components).

### Import Map

In order for Payload to make use of [Component Paths](#component-paths), an "Import Map" is automatically generated at `app/(payload)/admin/importMap.js`. This file contains every Custom Component in your config, keyed to their respective paths. When Payload needs to lookup a component, it uses this file to find the correct import.

The Import Map is automatically regenerated at startup and whenever Hot Module Replacement (HMR) runs, or you can run `payload generate:importmap` to manually regenerate it.

#### Custom Imports

If needed, custom items can be appended onto the Import Map. This is mostly only relevant for plugin authors who need to add a custom import that is not referenced in a known location.

To add a custom import to the Import Map, use the `admin.dependencies` property in your [Payload Config](../getting-started/overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    // ...
    dependencies: {
      myTestComponent: { // myTestComponent is the key - can be anything
        path: '/components/TestComponent.js#TestComponent',
        type: 'component',
        clientProps: {
          test: 'hello',
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
```

## Building Custom Components

All Custom Components in Payload are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default. This enables the use of the [Local API](../local-api/overview) directly on the front-end, among other things.

### Default Props

To make building Custom Components as easy as possible, Payload automatically provides common props, such as the [`payload`](../local-api/overview) class and the [`i18n`](../configuration/i18n) object. This means that when building Custom Components within the Admin Panel, you do not have to get these yourself.

Here is an example:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

const MyServerComponent = async ({
  payload // highlight-line
}) => {
  const page = await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'pages',
    id: '123',
  })

  return (
    <p>{page.title}</p>
  )
}
```

Each Custom Component receives the following props by default:

| Prop                      | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payload`                 | The [Payload](../local-api/overview) class.                                                           |
| `i18n`                    | The [i18n](../configuration/i18n) object.                                                                           |

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  All Custom Components also receive various other props that are specific component being rendered. See [Root Components](#root-components), [Collection Components](./collections#custom-components), [Global Components](./globals#custom-components), or [Field Components](./fields#custom-components) for a complete list of all default props per component.
</Banner>

### Custom Props

To pass in custom props from the config, you can use either the `clientProps` or `serverProps` properties depending on whether your prop is [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types), and whether your component is a Server or Client Component.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    components: {
      logout: {
        Button: {
          path: '/src/components/Logout#MyComponent',
          clientProps: {
            myCustomProp: 'Hello, World!' // highlight-line
          },
        }
      }
    }
  },
})
```

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'

export const MyComponent = ({ myCustomProp }: { myCustomProp: string }) => {
  return (
    <button>{myCustomProp}</button>
  )
}
```

### Client Components

When [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components), it's still possible to use client-side code such as `useState` or the `window` object. To do this, simply add the `use client` directive at the top of your file. Payload will automatically detect and remove all default, [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) before rendering your component.

```tsx
'use client' // highlight-line
import React, { useState } from 'react'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  Client Components cannot be passed [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types). If you are rendering your Client Component _from within_ a Server Component, ensure that its props are serializable.
</Banner>

### Accessing the Payload Config

From any Server Component, the [Payload Config](../configuration/overview) can be accessed directly from the `payload` prop:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export default async function MyServerComponent({
  payload: {
    config // highlight-line
  }
}) {
  return (
    <Link href={config.serverURL}>
      Go Home
    </Link>
  )
}
```

But, the Payload Config is [non-serializable](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types) by design. It is full of custom validation functions, React components, etc. This means that the Payload Config, in its entirety, cannot be passed directly to Client Components.

For this reason, Payload creates a Client Config and passes it into the Config Provider. This is a serializable version of the Payload Config that can be accessed from any Client Component via the [`useConfig`](./hooks#useconfig) hook:

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useConfig } from '@payloadcms/ui'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { config: { serverURL } } = useConfig() // highlight-line

  return (
    <Link href={serverURL}>
      Go Home
    </Link>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  See [Using Hooks](#using-hooks) for more details.
</Banner>

All [Field Components](./fields) automatically receive their respective Field Config through props.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import type { TextFieldServerComponent } from 'payload'

export const MyClientFieldComponent: TextFieldServerComponent = ({ field: { name } }) => {
  return (
    <p>
      {`This field's name is ${name}`}
    </p>
  )
}
```

### Getting the Current Language

All Custom Components can support multiple languages to be consistent with Payload's [Internationalization](../configuration/i18n). To do this, first add your translation resources to the [I18n Config](../configuration/i18n).

From any Server Component, you can translate resources using the `getTranslation` function from `@payloadcms/translations`. All Server Components automatically receive the `i18n` object as a prop by default.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { getTranslation } from '@payloadcms/translations'

export default async function MyServerComponent({ i18n }) {
  const translatedTitle = getTranslation(myTranslation, i18n) // highlight-line

  return (
    <p>{translatedTitle}</p>
  )
}
```

The best way to do this within a Client Component is to import the `useTranslation` hook from `@payloadcms/ui`:

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useTranslation } from '@payloadcms/ui'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation() // highlight-line

  return (
    <ul>
      <li>{t('namespace1:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{t('namespace2:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{i18n.language}</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.
</Banner>

### Getting the Current Locale

All [Custom Views](./views) can support multiple locales to be consistent with Payload's [Localization](../configuration/localization). They automatically receive the `locale` object as a prop by default. This can be used to scope API requests, etc.:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export default async function MyServerComponent({ payload, locale }) {
  const localizedPage = await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'pages',
    id: '123',
    locale,
  })

  return (
    <p>{localizedPage.title}</p>
  )
}
```

The best way to do this within a Client Component is to import the `useLocale` hook from `@payloadcms/ui`:

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useLocale } from '@payloadcms/ui'

const Greeting: React.FC = () => {
  const locale = useLocale() // highlight-line

  const trans = {
    en: 'Hello',
    es: 'Hola',
  }

  return (
    <span>{trans[locale.code]}</span>
  )
}
```

  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.
</Banner>

### Using Hooks

To make it easier to [build your Custom Components](#building-custom-components), you can use [Payload's built-in React Hooks](./hooks) in any Client Component. For example, you might want to interact with one of Payload's many React Contexts. To do this, you can one of the many hooks available depending on your needs.

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useDocumentInfo } from '@payloadcms/ui'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { slug } = useDocumentInfo() // highlight-line

  return (
    <p>{`Entity slug: ${slug}`}</p>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.
</Banner>

### Adding Styles

Payload has a robust [CSS Library](./customizing-css) that you can use to style your Custom Components similarly to Payload's built-in styling. This will ensure that your Custom Components match the existing design system, and so that they automatically adapt to any theme changes that might occur.

To apply custom styles, simply import your own `.css` or `.scss` file into your Custom Component:

```tsx
import './index.scss'

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      My Custom Component
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then to colorize your Custom Component's background, for example, you can use the following CSS:

```scss
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--theme-elevation-500);
}
```

Payload also exports its [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) library for reuse which includes mixins, etc. To use this, simply import it as follows into your `.scss` file:

```scss
@import '~@payloadcms/ui/scss';

.my-component {
  @include mid-break {
    background-color: var(--theme-elevation-900);
  }
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  You can also drill into Payload's own component styles, or easily apply global, app-wide CSS. More on that [here](./customizing-css).
</Banner>


## Root Components

Root Components are those that effect the [Admin Panel](./overview) generally, such as the logo or the main nav.

To override Root Components, use the `admin.components` property in your [Payload Config](../getting-started/overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    components: {
      // ...
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
})
```

_For details on how to build Custom Components, see [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components)._

### Custom Providers

As you add more and more Custom Components to your [Admin Panel](./overview), you may find it helpful to add additional [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)(s). Payload allows you to inject your own context providers in your app so you can export your own custom hooks, etc.

To add a Custom Provider, use the `admin.components.providers` property in your [Payload Config](../getting-started/overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      providers: ['/path/to/MyProvider'], // highlight-line
    },
  },
})
```

Then build your Custom Provider as follows:

```tsx
'use client'
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const MyCustomContext = React.createContext(myCustomValue)

export const MyProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <MyCustomContext.Provider value={myCustomValue}>
      {children}
    </MyCustomContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useMyCustomContext = () => useContext(MyCustomContext)
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong>React Context exists only within Client Components. This means they must include the `use client` directive at the top of their files and cannot contain server-only code. To use a Server Component here, simply _wrap_ your Client Component with it.
</Banner>
