Queues are the final aspect of Payload's Jobs Queue and deal with how to _run your jobs_. Up to this point, all we've covered is how to queue up jobs to run, but so far, we aren't actually running any jobs.

<Banner type="default">
  A **Queue** is a grouping of jobs that should be executed in order of when
  they were added.
</Banner>

When you go to run jobs, Payload will query for any jobs that are added to the queue and then run them. By default, all queued jobs are added to the `default` queue.

**But, imagine if you wanted to have some jobs that run nightly, and other jobs which should run every five minutes.**

By specifying the `queue` name when you queue a new job using `payload.jobs.queue()`, you can queue certain jobs with `queue: 'nightly'`, and other jobs can be left as the default queue.

Then, you could configure two different runner strategies:

1. A `cron` that runs nightly, querying for jobs added to the `nightly` queue
2. Another that runs any jobs that were added to the `default` queue every ~5 minutes or so

## Executing jobs

As mentioned above, you can queue jobs, but the jobs won't run unless a worker picks up your jobs and runs them. This can be done in four ways:

### Cron jobs

The `jobs.autoRun` property allows you to configure cron jobs that automatically run queued jobs at specified intervals. Note that this does not _queue_ new jobs - only _runs_ jobs that are already in the specified queue.

**Example**:

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // Other configurations...
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      // your tasks here
    ],
    // autoRun can optionally be a function that receives `payload` as an argument
    autoRun: [
      {
        cron: '0 * * * *', // every hour at minute 0
        limit: 100, // limit jobs to process each run
        queue: 'hourly', // name of the queue
      },
      // add as many cron jobs as you want
    ],
    shouldAutoRun: async (payload) => {
      // Tell Payload if it should run jobs or not. This function is optional and will return true by default.
      // This function will be invoked each time Payload goes to pick up and run jobs.
      // If this function ever returns false, the cron schedule will be stopped.
      return true
    },
  },
})
```

<Banner type="warning">
  autoRun is intended for use with a dedicated server that is always running,
  and should not be used on serverless platforms like Vercel.
</Banner>

### Endpoint

You can execute jobs by making a fetch request to the `/api/payload-jobs/run` endpoint:

```ts
// Here, we're saying we want to run only 100 jobs for this invocation
// and we want to pull jobs from the `nightly` queue:
await fetch('/api/payload-jobs/run?limit=100&queue=nightly', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
})
```

This endpoint is automatically mounted for you and is helpful in conjunction with serverless platforms like Vercel, where you might want to use Vercel Cron to invoke a serverless function that executes your jobs.

#### Query Parameters

- `limit`: The maximum number of jobs to run in this invocation (default: 10).
- `queue`: The name of the queue to run jobs from. If not specified, jobs will be run from the `default` queue.
- `allQueues`: If set to `true`, all jobs from all queues will be run. This will ignore the `queue` parameter.

#### Vercel Cron Example

If you're deploying on Vercel, you can add a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project that configures Vercel Cron to invoke the `run` endpoint on a cron schedule.

Here's an example of what this file will look like:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/payload-jobs/run",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

The configuration above schedules the endpoint `/api/payload-jobs/run` to be invoked every 5 minutes.

The last step will be to secure your `run` endpoint so that only the proper users can invoke the runner.

To do this, you can set an environment variable on your Vercel project called `CRON_SECRET`, which should be a random string—ideally 16 characters or longer.

Then, you can modify the `access` function for running jobs by ensuring that only Vercel can invoke your runner.

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // Other configurations...
  jobs: {
    access: {
      run: ({ req }: { req: PayloadRequest }): boolean => {
        // Allow logged in users to execute this endpoint (default)
        if (req.user) return true

        const secret = process.env.CRON_SECRET
        if (!secret) return false

        // If there is no logged in user, then check
        // for the Vercel Cron secret to be present as an
        // Authorization header:
        const authHeader = req.headers.get('authorization')
        return authHeader === `Bearer ${secret}`
      },
    },
    // Other job configurations...
  },
})
```

This works because Vercel automatically makes the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable available to the endpoint as the `Authorization` header when triggered by the Vercel Cron, ensuring that the jobs can be run securely.

After the project is deployed to Vercel, the Vercel Cron job will automatically trigger the `/api/payload-jobs/run` endpoint in the specified schedule, running the queued jobs in the background.

### Local API

If you want to process jobs programmatically from your server-side code, you can use the Local API:

**Run all jobs:**

```ts
// Run all jobs from the `default` queue - default limit is 10
const results = await payload.jobs.run()

// You can customize the queue name and limit by passing them as arguments:
await payload.jobs.run({ queue: 'nightly', limit: 100 })

// Run all jobs from all queues:
await payload.jobs.run({ allQueues: true })

// You can provide a where clause to filter the jobs that should be run:
await payload.jobs.run({
  where: { 'input.message': { equals: 'secret' } },
})
```

**Run a single job:**

```ts
const results = await payload.jobs.runByID({
  id: myJobID,
})
```

### Bin script

Finally, you can process jobs via the bin script that comes with Payload out of the box. By default, this script will run jobs from the `default` queue, with a limit of 10 jobs per invocation:

```sh
pnpm payload jobs:run
```

You can override the default queue and limit by passing the `--queue` and `--limit` flags:

```sh
pnpm payload jobs:run --queue myQueue --limit 15
```

If you want to run all jobs from all queues, you can pass the `--all-queues` flag:

```sh
pnpm payload jobs:run --all-queues
```

In addition, the bin script allows you to pass a `--cron` flag to the `jobs:run` command to run the jobs on a scheduled, cron basis:

```sh
pnpm payload jobs:run --cron "*/5 * * * *"
```

You can also pass `--handle-schedules` flag to the `jobs:run` command to make it schedule jobs according to configured schedules:

```sh
pnpm payload jobs:run --cron "*/5 * * * *" --queue myQueue --handle-schedules # This will both schedule jobs according to the configuration and run them
```

## Processing Order

By default, jobs are processed first in, first out (FIFO). This means that the first job added to the queue will be the first one processed. However, you can also configure the order in which jobs are processed.

### Jobs Configuration

You can configure the order in which jobs are processed in the jobs configuration by passing the `processingOrder` property. This mimics the Payload [sort](../queries/sort) property that's used for functionality such as `payload.find()`.

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // Other configurations...
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      // your tasks here
    ],
    processingOrder: '-createdAt', // Process jobs in reverse order of creation = LIFO
  },
})
```

You can also set this on a queue-by-queue basis:

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // Other configurations...
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      // your tasks here
    ],
    processingOrder: {
      default: 'createdAt', // FIFO
      queues: {
        nightly: '-createdAt', // LIFO
        myQueue: '-createdAt', // LIFO
      },
    },
  },
})
```

If you need even more control over the processing order, you can pass a function that returns the processing order - this function will be called every time a queue starts processing jobs.

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // Other configurations...
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      // your tasks here
    ],
    processingOrder: ({ queue }) => {
      if (queue === 'myQueue') {
        return '-createdAt' // LIFO
      }
      return 'createdAt' // FIFO
    },
  },
})
```

### Local API

You can configure the order in which jobs are processed in the `payload.jobs.queue` method by passing the `processingOrder` property.

```ts
const createdJob = await payload.jobs.queue({
  workflow: 'createPostAndUpdate',
  input: {
    title: 'my title',
  },
  processingOrder: '-createdAt', // Process jobs in reverse order of creation = LIFO
})
```

## Common Queue Strategies

Here are typical patterns for organizing your queues:

### Priority-Based Queues

Separate jobs by priority to ensure critical tasks run quickly:

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      /* ... */
    ],
    autoRun: [
      {
        cron: '* * * * *', // Every minute
        limit: 100,
        queue: 'critical',
      },
      {
        cron: '*/5 * * * *', // Every 5 minutes
        limit: 50,
        queue: 'default',
      },
      {
        cron: '0 2 * * *', // Daily at 2 AM
        limit: 1000,
        queue: 'batch',
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

Then queue jobs to appropriate queues:

```ts
// Critical: Password resets, payment confirmations
await payload.jobs.queue({
  task: 'sendPasswordReset',
  input: { userId: '123' },
  queue: 'critical',
})

// Default: Welcome emails, notifications
await payload.jobs.queue({
  task: 'sendWelcomeEmail',
  input: { userId: '123' },
  queue: 'default',
})

// Batch: Analytics, reports, cleanups
await payload.jobs.queue({
  task: 'generateAnalytics',
  input: { date: new Date() },
  queue: 'batch',
})
```

### Environment-Based Execution

Only run jobs on specific servers:

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      /* ... */
    ],
    shouldAutoRun: async (payload) => {
      // Only run jobs if this env var is set
      return process.env.ENABLE_JOB_WORKERS === 'true'
    },
    autoRun: [
      {
        cron: '*/5 * * * *',
        limit: 50,
        queue: 'default',
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

**Use cases:**

- Dedicate specific servers to job processing
- Disable job processing during deployments
- Scale job workers independently from API servers

### Feature-Based Queues

Group jobs by feature or domain:

```ts
autoRun: [
  { cron: '*/2 * * * *', queue: 'emails', limit: 100 },
  { cron: '*/10 * * * *', queue: 'images', limit: 50 },
  { cron: '0 * * * *', queue: 'analytics', limit: 1000 },
]
```

This makes it easy to:

- Monitor specific features
- Scale individual features independently
- Pause/resume specific types of work

## Choosing an Execution Method

Here's a quick guide to help you choose:

| Method                    | Best For                               | Pros                                   | Cons                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cron jobs** (`autoRun`) | Dedicated servers, long-running apps   | Simple setup, automatic execution      | Not for serverless, requires always-running server |
| **Endpoint**              | Serverless platforms (Vercel, Netlify) | Works with serverless, easy to trigger | Requires external cron (Vercel Cron, etc.)         |
| **Local API**             | Custom scheduling, testing             | Full control, good for tests           | Must implement your own scheduling                 |
| **Bin script**            | Development, manual execution          | Quick testing, manual control          | Manual invocation only                             |

**Recommendations:**

- **Production (Serverless):** Use Endpoint + Vercel Cron
- **Production (Server):** Use Cron jobs (`autoRun`)
- **Development:** Use Bin script or Local API
- **Testing:** Use Local API with `payload.jobs.runByID()`

## Troubleshooting

Jobs aren't running

**Is `shouldAutoRun` returning true?**

```ts
jobs: {
  shouldAutoRun: async (payload) => {
    console.log('shouldAutoRun called') // Add logging
    return true
  },
}
```

**Is `autoRun` configured correctly?**

```ts
// invalid cron syntax
autoRun: [{ cron: 'every 5 minutes' }]

// valid cron syntax
autoRun: [{ cron: '*/5 * * * *' }]
```

**Are jobs in the correct queue?**

```ts
// Queuing to 'critical' queue
await payload.jobs.queue({ task: 'myTask', queue: 'critical' })

// But autoRun only processes 'default' queue
autoRun: [{ queue: 'default' }] // won't pick up the job
```

**Check the jobs collection**

Enable the jobs collection in admin:

```ts
jobsCollectionOverrides: ({ defaultJobsCollection }) => ({
  ...defaultJobsCollection,
  admin: {
    ...defaultJobsCollection.admin,
    hidden: false,
  },
})
```

Look for jobs with:

- `processing: true` but stuck → Worker may have crashed
- `hasError: true` → Check the `log` field for errors
- `completedAt: null` → Job hasn't run yet

### Jobs running but failing

Check the job logs in the `payload-jobs` collection:

```ts
const job = await payload.findByID({
  collection: 'payload-jobs',
  id: jobId,
})

console.log(job.log) // View execution log
console.log(job.processingErrors) // View errors
```

### Jobs running too slowly

**Increase limit**

```ts
autoRun: [
  { cron: '*/5 * * * *', limit: 100 }, // Process more jobs per run
]
```

**Run more frequently**

```ts
autoRun: [
  { cron: '* * * * *', limit: 50 }, // Run every minute instead of every 5
]
```

**Add more workers**

Scale horizontally by running multiple servers with `ENABLE_JOB_WORKERS=true`.
