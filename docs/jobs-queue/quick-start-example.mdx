Let's walk through a practical example of setting up a simple job queue. We'll create a task that sends a welcome email when a user signs up.

You might wonder: "Why not just send the email directly in the `afterChange` hook?"

- **Non-blocking**: If your email service takes 2-3 seconds to send, your API response would be delayed. With jobs, the API returns immediately.
- **Resilience**: If the email service is temporarily down, the hook would fail and potentially block the user creation. Jobs can retry automatically.
- **Scalability**: As your app grows, you can move job processing to dedicated servers, keeping your API fast.
- **Monitoring**: All jobs are tracked in the database, so you can see if emails failed and why.

Now let's build this example step by step.

**Step 1: Define a Task**

First, create a task in your `payload.config.ts`:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import type { TaskConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ... other config
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      {
        slug: 'sendWelcomeEmail',
        retries: 3,
        inputSchema: [
          {
            name: 'userEmail',
            type: 'email',
            required: true,
          },
          {
            name: 'userName',
            type: 'text',
            required: true,
          },
        ],
        handler: async ({ input, req }) => {
          // Send email using your email service
          await req.payload.sendEmail({
            to: input.userEmail,
            subject: 'Welcome!',
            text: `Hi ${input.userName}, welcome to our platform!`,
          })

          return {
            output: {
              emailSent: true,
            },
          }
        },
      } as TaskConfig<'sendWelcomeEmail'>,
    ],
  },
})
```

**Step 2: Queue the Job Trigger the job from a collection hook:**

```ts
{
  slug: 'users',
  hooks: {
    afterChange: [
      async ({ req, doc, operation }) => {
        // Only send welcome email for new users
        if (operation === 'create') {
          await req.payload.jobs.queue({
            task: 'sendWelcomeEmail',
            input: {
              userEmail: doc.email,
              userName: doc.name,
            },
          })
        }
      },
    ],
  },
  // ... fields
}
```

**Step 3: Run the Jobs Configure automatic job execution:**

```ts
export default buildConfig({
  // ... other config
  jobs: {
    tasks: [
      /* ... */
    ],
    autoRun: [
      {
        cron: '*/5 * * * *', // Run every 5 minutes
        limit: 50,
        queue: 'default',
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

That's it! Now when users sign up, a job is queued and will be processed within 5 minutes without blocking the API response.
