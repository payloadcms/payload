  So you've developed a Payload app, it's fully tested, and running great locally. Now it's time to
  launch. <strong>Awesome! Great work!</strong> Now, what's next?
</Banner>

There are many ways to deploy Payload to a production environment. When evaluating how you will deploy Payload, you need
to consider these main aspects:

1. [Basics](#basics)
1. [Security](#security)
1. [Your database](#database)
1. [Permanent File Storage](#file-storage)
1. [Docker](#docker)

Payload can be deployed _anywhere that Next.js can run_ - including Vercel, Netlify, SST, DigitalOcean, AWS, and more. Because it's open source, you can self-host it.

But it's important to remember that most Payload projects will also need a database, file storage, an email provider, and a CDN. Make sure you have all of the requirements that your project needs, no matter what deployment platform you choose.

Often, the easiest and fastest way to deploy Payload is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new) â€” where you get everything you need out of the box, including:

1. A MongoDB Atlas database
1. S3 file storage
1. Resend email service
1. Cloudflare CDN
1. Blue / green deployments
1. Logs
1. And more

## Basics

Payload runs fully in Next.js, so the [Next.js build process](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) is used for building Payload. If you've used `create-payload-app` to create your project, executing the `build`
npm script will build Payload for production.

## Security

Payload features a suite of security features that you can rely on to strengthen your application's security. When
deploying to Production, it's a good idea to double-check that you are making proper use of each of them.

### The Secret Key

When you initialize Payload, you provide it with a `secret` property. This property should be impossible to guess and
extremely difficult for brute-force attacks to crack. Make sure your Production `secret` is a long, complex string.

### Double-check and thoroughly test all Access Control

Because _**you**_ are in complete control of who can do what with your data, you should double and triple-check that you
wield that power responsibly before deploying to Production.

<Banner type="error">
  <strong>
    By default, all Access Control functions require that a user is successfully logged in to
    Payload to create, read, update, or delete data.
  </strong>
  But, if you allow public user registration, for example, you will want to make sure that your
  access control functions are more strict - permitting
  {' '}
  <strong>
    only appropriate users
  </strong>
  {' '}
  to perform appropriate actions.
</Banner>

### Running in Production

Depending on where you deploy Payload, you may need to provide a start script to your deployment platform in order to start up Payload in production mode.

Note that this is different than running `next dev`. Generally, Next.js apps come configured with a `start` script which runs `next start`.

### Secure Cookie Settings

You should be using an SSL certificate for production Payload instances, which means you
can [enable secure cookies](/docs/authentication/overview) in your Authentication-enabled Collection configs.

### Preventing API Abuse

Payload comes with a robust set of built-in anti-abuse measures, such as locking out users after X amount of failed
login attempts, GraphQL query complexity limits, max `depth` settings, and
more. [Click here to learn more](/docs/production/preventing-abuse).

## Database

Payload can be used with any Postgres database or MongoDB-compatible database including AWS DocumentDB or Azure Cosmos DB. Make sure your production environment has access to the database that Payload uses.

Out of the box, Payload templates pass the `process.env.DATABASE_URI` environment variable to its database adapters, so make sure you've got that environment variable (and all others that you use) assigned in your deployment platform.

### DocumentDB

When using AWS DocumentDB, you will need to configure connection options for authentication in the `connectOptions`
passed to the `mongooseAdapter` . You also need to set `connectOptions.useFacet` to `false` to disable use of the
unsupported `$facet` aggregation.

### CosmosDB

When using Azure Cosmos DB, an index is needed for any field you may want to sort on. To add the sort index for all
fields that may be sorted in the admin UI use the <a href="/docs/configuration/overview">indexSortableFields</a>
configuration option.

## File storage

If you are using Payload to [manage file uploads](/docs/upload/overview), you need to consider where your uploaded files
will be permanently stored. If you do not use Payload for file uploads, then this section does not impact your app
whatsoever.

### Persistent vs Ephemeral Filesystems

Some cloud app hosts such as [Heroku](https://heroku.com) use `ephemeral` file systems, which means that any files
uploaded to your server only last until the server restarts or shuts down. Heroku and similar providers schedule
restarts and shutdowns without your control, meaning your uploads will accidentally disappear without any way to get
them back.

Alternatively, persistent filesystems will never delete your files and can be trusted to reliably host uploads
perpetually.

**Popular cloud providers with ephemeral filesystems:**

- Heroku
- DigitalOcean Apps

**Popular cloud providers with persistent filesystems:**

- DigitalOcean Droplets
- Amazon EC2
- GoDaddy
- Many other more traditional web hosts

<Banner type="error">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  <br />
  If you rely on Payload's <strong>Upload</strong> functionality, make sure you either use a host
  with a persistent filesystem or have an integration with a third-party file host like Amazon S3.
</Banner>

### Using cloud storage providers

If you don't use Payload's `upload` functionality, you can completely disregard this section.

But, if you do, and you still want to use an ephemeral filesystem provider, you can use one of Payload's official cloud storage plugins or write your own to save the files your users upload to a more permanent storage solution like Amazon S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces.

Payload provides a list of official cloud storage adapters for you to use:

- [Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/storage-azure)
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/storage-gcs)
- [AWS S3](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/storage-s3)
- [Uploadthing](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/storage-uploadthing)
- [Vercel Blob Storage](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/storage-vercel-blob)

Follow the docs to configure any one of these storage providers. For local development, it might be handy to simply store uploads on your own computer, and then when it comes to production, simply enable the plugin for the cloud storage vendor of your choice.

## Docker

This is an example of a multi-stage docker build of Payload for production. Ensure you are setting your environment
variables on deployment, like `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH`, and `DATABASE_URI` if needed.

In your Next.js config, set the `output` property `standalone`.

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
}
```
