Trash (also known as soft delete) allows documents to be marked as deleted without being permanently removed. When enabled on a collection, deleted documents will receive a `deletedAt` timestamp, making it possible to restore them later, view them in a dedicated Trash view, or permanently delete them.

Soft delete is a safer way to manage content lifecycle, giving editors a chance to review and recover documents that may have been deleted by mistake.

## Collection Configuration

To enable soft deleting for a collection, set the `trash` property to `true`:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  trash: true,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
    },
    // other fields...
  ],
}
```

When enabled, Payload automatically injects a deletedAt field into the collection's schema. This timestamp is set when a document is soft-deleted, and cleared when the document is restored.

## Admin Panel behavior

Once `trash` is enabled, the Admin Panel provides a dedicated Trash view for each collection:

- A new route is added at `/collections/:collectionSlug/trash`
- The `Trash` view shows all documents that have a `deletedAt` timestamp

From the Trash view, you can:

- Use bulk actions to manage trashed documents:

  - **Restore** to clear the `deletedAt` timestamp and return documents to their original state
  - **Delete** to permanently remove selected documents
  - **Empty Trash** to select and permanently delete all trashed documents at once

- Enter each document's **edit view**, just like in the main list view. While in the edit view of a trashed document:
  - All fields are in a **read-only** state
  - Standard document actions (e.g., Save, Publish, Restore Version) are hidden and disabled.
  - The available actions are **Restore** and **Permanently Delete**.
  - Access to the **API**, **Versions**, and **Preview** views is preserved.

When deleting a document from the main collection List View, Payload will soft-delete the document by default. A checkbox in the delete confirmation modal allows users to skip the trash and permanently delete instead.

## API Support

Soft deletes are fully supported across all Payload APIs: **Local**, **REST**, and **GraphQL**.

The following operations respect and support the `trash` functionality:

- `find`
- `findByID`
- `update`
- `updateByID`
- `delete`
- `deleteByID`
- `findVersions`
- `findVersionByID`

### Understanding `trash` Behavior

Passing `trash: true` to these operations will **include soft-deleted documents** in the query results.

To return _only_ soft-deleted documents, you must combine `trash: true` with a `where` clause that checks if `deletedAt` exists.

### Examples

#### Local API

Return all documents including trashed:

```ts
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  trash: true,
})
```

Return only trashed documents:

```ts
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  trash: true,
  where: {
    deletedAt: {
      exists: true,
    },
  },
})
```

Return only non-trashed documents:

```ts
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  trash: false,
})
```

#### REST

Return **all** documents including trashed:

```http
GET /api/posts?trash=true
```

Return **only trashed** documents:

```http
GET /api/posts?trash=true&where[deletedAt][exists]=true
```

Return only non-trashed documents:

```http
GET /api/posts?trash=false
```

#### GraphQL

Return all documents including trashed:

```ts
query {
  Posts(trash: true) {
    docs {
      id
      deletedAt
    }
  }
}
```

Return only trashed documents:

```ts
query {
  Posts(
    trash: true
    where: { deletedAt: { exists: true } }
  ) {
    docs {
      id
      deletedAt
    }
  }
}
```

Return only non-trashed documents:

```ts
query {
  Posts(trash: false) {
    docs {
      id
      deletedAt
    }
  }
}
```

## Access Control

All trash-related actions (soft delete, permanent delete, restore) respect the `delete` access control defined in your collection config.

This means:

- If a user is denied delete access, they cannot soft delete or permanently delete documents

### Differentiating Between Trash and Permanent Delete

You can configure access control to allow some users to trash documents while restricting permanent deletion to admins only. This is useful when you want editors to be able to "delete" content (move to trash) but only allow administrators to permanently remove data.

The `delete` access control function receives a `data` argument that contains the document data being set during the operation:

- **When trashing:** `data.deletedAt` will be set to a timestamp
- **When permanently deleting:** `data` will be `undefined`

This pattern is similar to how `publish` access control works with `data._status`.

#### Example: Allow All Users to Trash, Only Admins to Permanently Delete

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  trash: true,
  access: {
    delete: ({ req: { user }, data }) => {
      // Not logged in - no access
      if (!user) {
        return false
      }

      // Admins can do anything (trash or permanently delete)
      if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) {
        return true
      }

      // Regular users: check what operation they're attempting
      // If data.deletedAt is being set, it's a trash operation - allow it
      if (data?.deletedAt) {
        return true
      }

      // Otherwise it's a permanent delete - deny for non-admins
      return false
    },
  },
  fields: [
    // ...
  ],
}
```

#### Example: Only Admins Can Delete (Both Trash and Permanent)

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const SensitiveData: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'sensitive-data',
  trash: true,
  access: {
    delete: ({ req: { user } }) => {
      // Only allow admins to trash or permanently delete
      return Boolean(user?.roles?.includes('admin'))
    },
  },
  fields: [
    // ...
  ],
}
```

In the Admin Panel, when a user has permission to trash but not permanently delete:

- The delete button will be visible
- The "Delete permanently" checkbox in the confirmation modal will be hidden
- The user can only move documents to trash

## Versions and Trash

When a document is soft-deleted:

- It can no longer have a version **restored** until it is first restored from trash
- Attempting to restore a version while the document is in trash will result in an error
- This ensures consistency between the current document state and its version history

However, versions are still fully **visible and accessible** from the **edit view** of a trashed document. You can view the full version history, but must restore the document itself before restoring any individual version.
