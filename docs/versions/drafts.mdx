Payload's Draft functionality builds on top of the Versions functionality to allow you to make changes to your collection documents and globals, but publish only when you're ready. This functionality allows you to build powerful Preview environments for your data, where you can make sure your changes look good before publishing documents.

<Banner type="warning">
  Drafts rely on Versions being enabled in order to function.
</Banner>

By enabling Versions with Drafts, your collections and globals can maintain _newer_, and _unpublished_ versions of your documents. It's perfect for cases where you might want to work on a document, update it and save your progress, but not necessarily make it publicly published right away. Drafts are extremely helpful when building preview implementations.

_If Drafts are enabled, the typical Save button is replaced with new actions which allow you to either save a draft, or publish your changes._

## Options

Collections and Globals both support the same options for configuring drafts. You can either set `versions.drafts` to `true`, or pass an object to configure draft properties.

| Draft Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autosave`        | Enable `autosave` to automatically save progress while documents are edited. To enable, set to `true` or pass an object with [options](/docs/versions/autosave). |
| `localizeStatus`  | **Beta**. Localizes the `_status` field when using [Localization](/docs/configuration/localization). Default is `false`.                                         |
| `schedulePublish` | Allow for editors to schedule publish / unpublish events in the future. [More](#scheduled-publish)                                                               |
| `validate`        | Set `validate` to `true` to validate draft documents when saved. Default is `false`.                                                                             |

## Database changes

By enabling drafts on a collection or a global, Payload will **automatically inject a new field into your schema** called `_status`. The `_status` field is used internally by Payload to store if a document is set to `draft` or `published`.

**Admin UI status indication**

Within the Admin UI, if drafts are enabled, a document can be shown with one of three "statuses":

1. **Draft** - if a document has never been published, and only draft versions of the document
   are present
1. **Published** - if a document is published and there are no newer drafts available
1. **Changed** - if a document has been published, but there are newer drafts available
   and not yet published

## Draft API

<Banner type="success">
  If drafts are enabled on your collection or global, important and powerful
  changes are made to your REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs that allow you to
  specify if you are interacting with drafts or with live documents.
</Banner>

#### Using the `draft` parameter

When drafts are enabled, the `create`, `update`, `find`, and `findByID` operations for REST, GraphQL, and Local APIs expose a `draft` parameter. For write operations, it controls validation and where data is written. For read operations, it determines whether to return draft versions.

```ts
// REST API
POST /api/your-collection?draft=true

// Local API
await payload.create({
  collection: 'your-collection',
  data: {
    // your data here
  },
  draft: true,
})

// GraphQL
mutation {
  createYourCollection(data: { ... }, draft: true) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Understanding `draft` parameter and `_status` field**

The `draft` parameter and `_status` field work together but serve different purposes:

**`draft` parameter** - Controls two things:

1. **Validation**: When `draft: true`, required fields are not enforced, allowing you to save incomplete documents
2. **Write location**: Determines whether the main collection document is updated
   - `draft: true` - Saves ONLY to versions table (main collection unchanged)
   - `draft: false` or omitted - Saves to BOTH main collection AND versions table

**`_status` field** - Indicates whether a document is published or in draft state

- Defaults to `'draft'` when not explicitly provided
- Can be explicitly set in your data to `'published'` or `'draft'`

**First document creation**

When you first create a document, it's always written to the main collection (since no document exists yet):

- If you don't specify `_status`, it defaults to `_status: 'draft'`
- A version is also created in the versions table
- The `draft` parameter controls validation but doesn't change where the initial document is written

**Subsequent updates**

After initial creation, the `draft` parameter controls where your updates are written:

- **`draft: true`** - Only the versions table is updated; the main collection document remains unchanged
- **`draft: false` or omitted** - Both the main collection and versions table are updated

**Important:** The `draft` parameter does NOT control whether a document is published or not. A document remains with `_status: 'draft'` by default unless you explicitly set `_status: 'published'` in your data.

**Publishing a document**

To publish a document, you must explicitly set `_status: 'published'` in your data. When you do this:

- If you use `draft: false` or omit it, the main collection will be updated with the published status
- If you use `draft: true`, the `_status: 'published'` takes precedence and will still update the main collection as published (overriding the `draft: true` behavior)

**Quick reference**

| Operation | `draft` param      | `_status` in data    | Result                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create    | `true` or `false`  | omitted              | Main collection updated with `_status: 'draft'`                |
| Create    | `true` or `false`  | `'published'`        | Main collection updated with `_status: 'published'`            |
| Update    | `true`             | omitted or `'draft'` | Only versions table updated, main collection unchanged         |
| Update    | `true`             | `'published'`        | Main collection updated with `_status: 'published'` (override) |
| Update    | `false` or omitted | omitted              | Main collection updated with `_status: 'draft'`                |
| Update    | `false` or omitted | `'published'`        | Main collection updated with `_status: 'published'`            |

**Required fields**

Setting `_status: "draft"` will not bypass required field validation. You need to set `draft: true` to save incomplete documents as shown in the previous examples.

#### Reading drafts vs. published documents

In addition to the `draft` argument within `create` and `update` operations, a `draft` argument is also exposed for `find` and `findByID` operations.

When `draft` is set to `true` while reading a document, **Payload will return the most recent version from the versions table**, regardless of whether it's a draft or published document.

**Example scenario:**

1. You create a document with `_status: 'published'` (published in main collection)
1. You update with `draft: true` to make changes without affecting the published version
1. You update again with `draft: true` to make more draft changes

At this point, your published document remains unchanged in the main collection, and you have two newer draft versions in the `_[collectionSlug]_versions` table.

When you fetch the document with a standard `find` or `findByID` operation, the published document from the main collection is returned and draft versions are ignored.

However, if you pass `draft: true` to the read operation, Payload will return the most recent version from the versions table. In the scenario above with two draft versions, you'll get the latest (second) draft.

**Note:** If there are no newer drafts (e.g., you published a document and haven't made draft changes since), querying with `draft: true` will still return the latest version from the versions table, which would be the same published content as in the main collection.

<Banner type="error">
  **Important:** the `draft` argument on its own will not restrict documents
  with `_status: 'draft'` from being returned from the API. You need to use
  Access Control to prevent documents with `_status: 'draft'` from being
  returned to unauthenticated users. Read below for more information on how this
  works.
</Banner>

## Controlling who can see Collection drafts

<Banner type="warning">
  If you're using the **drafts** feature, it's important for you to consider who
  can view your drafts, and who can view only published documents. Luckily,
  Payload makes this extremely simple and puts the power completely in your
  hands.
</Banner>

#### Restricting draft access

You can use the `read` [Access Control](../access-control/collections#read) method to restrict who is able to view drafts of your documents by simply returning a [query constraint](/docs/queries/overview) which restricts the documents that any given user is able to retrieve.

Here is an example that utilizes the `_status` field to require a user to be logged in to retrieve drafts:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  access: {
    read: ({ req }) => {
      // If there is a user logged in,
      // let them retrieve all documents
      if (req.user) return true

      // If there is no user,
      // restrict the documents that are returned
      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`
      return {
        _status: {
          equals: 'published',
        },
      }
    },
  },
  versions: {
    drafts: true,
  },
  //.. the rest of the Pages config here
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note regarding adding versions to an existing collection**

If you already have a collection with documents, and you _opt in_ to draft functionality
after you have already created existing documents, all of your old documents
_will not have a `_status` field_ until you resave them. For this reason, if you are
_adding_ versions into an existing collection, you might want to write your Access Control
function to allow for users to read both documents where
**`_status` is equal to `"published"`** as well as where
**`_status` does not exist**.

</Banner>

Here is an example for how to write an [Access Control](../access-control/overview) function that grants access to both documents where `_status` is equal to "published" and where `_status` does not exist:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  access: {
    read: ({ req }) => {
      // If there is a user logged in,
      // let them retrieve all documents
      if (req.user) return true

      // If there is no user,
      // restrict the documents that are returned
      // to only those where `_status` is equal to `published`
      // or where `_status` does not exist
      return {
        or: [
          {
            _status: {
              equals: 'published',
            },
          },
          {
            _status: {
              exists: false,
            },
          },
        ],
      }
    },
  },
  versions: {
    drafts: true,
  },
  //.. the rest of the Pages config here
}
```

## Scheduled publish

Payload provides for an ability to schedule publishing / unpublishing events in the future, which can be helpful if you need to set certain documents to "go live" at a given date in the future, or, vice versa, revert to a draft state after a certain time has passed.

You can enable this functionality on both collections and globals via the `versions.drafts.schedulePublish: true` property.

<Banner type="warning">
  **Important:** if you are going to enable scheduled publish / unpublish, you
  need to make sure your Payload app is set up to process
  [Jobs](/docs/jobs-queue/overview). This feature works by creating a Job in the
  background, which will be picked up after the job becomes available. If you do
  not have any mechanism in place to run jobs, your scheduled publish /
  unpublish jobs will never be executed.
</Banner>

## Unpublishing drafts

If a document is published, the Payload Admin UI will be updated to show an "unpublish" button at the top of the sidebar, which will "unpublish" the currently published document. Consider this as a way to "revert" a document back to a draft state. On the API side, this is done by simply setting `_status: 'draft'` on any document.

## Reverting to published

If a document is published, and you have made further changes which are saved as a draft, Payload will show a "revert to published" button at the top of the sidebar which will allow you to reject your draft changes and "revert" back to the published state of the document. Your drafts will still be saved, but a new version will be created that will reflect the last published state of the document.
