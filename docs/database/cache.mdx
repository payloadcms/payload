Cache documents in a key-value store to improve read performance for frequently accessed data.

To enable caching for database queries, pass `cache: true` as an argument to your operation:

```ts
const cachedDocs = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  cache: true,
})
```

Important:

Cached documents are considered fully formed, meaning any hooks that would normally run on read operations (e.g., `afterRead`) will not be executed when retrieving documents from the cache.
