To use Payload with MongoDB, install the package `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`. It will come with everything you need to
store your Payload data in MongoDB.

Then from there, pass it to your Payload Config as follows:

```ts
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'

export default buildConfig({
  // Your config goes here
  collections: [
    // Collections go here
  ],
  // Configure the Mongoose adapter here
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    // Mongoose-specific arguments go here.
    // URL is required.
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
})
```

## Options

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `autoPluralization`        | Tell Mongoose to auto-pluralize any collection names if it encounters any singular words used as collection `slug`s.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `connectOptions`           | Customize MongoDB connection options. Payload will connect to your MongoDB database using default options which you can override and extend to include all the [options](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) available to mongoose.                                                        |
| `collectionsSchemaOptions` | Customize Mongoose schema options for collections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `disableIndexHints`        | Set to true to disable hinting to MongoDB to use 'id' as index. This is currently done when counting documents for pagination, as it increases the speed of the count function used in that query. Disabling this optimization might fix some problems with AWS DocumentDB. Defaults to false                |
| `migrationDir`             | Customize the directory that migrations are stored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `transactionOptions`       | An object with configuration properties used in [transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/) or `false` which will disable the use of transactions.                                                                                                                                |
| `collation`                | Enable language-specific string comparison with customizable options. Available on MongoDB 3.4+. Defaults locale to "en". Example: `{ strength: 3 }`. For a full list of collation options and their definitions, see the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/). |
| `allowAdditionalKeys`      | By default, Payload strips all additional keys from MongoDB data that don't exist in the Payload schema. If you have some data that you want to include to the result but it doesn't exist in Payload, you can set this to `true`. Be careful as Payload access control _won't_ work for this data.          |
| `allowIDOnCreate`          | Set to `true` to use the `id` passed in data on the create API operations without using a custom ID field.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Access to Mongoose models

After Payload is initialized, this adapter exposes all of your Mongoose models and they are available for you to work
with directly.

You can access Mongoose models as follows:

- Collection models - `payload.db.collections[myCollectionSlug]`
- Globals model - `payload.db.globals`
- Versions model (both collections and globals) - `payload.db.versions[myEntitySlug]`

## Using other MongoDB implementations

Limitations with [DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) and [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db):

- For Azure Cosmos DB you must pass `transactionOptions: false` to the adapter options. Azure Cosmos DB does not support transactions that update two and more documents in different collections, which is a common case when using Payload (via hooks).
- For Azure Cosmos DB the root config property `indexSortableFields` must be set to `true`.
- The [Join Field](../fields/join) is not supported in DocumentDB and Azure Cosmos DB, as we internally use MongoDB aggregations to query data for that field, which are limited there. This can be changed in the future.
- For DocumentDB pass `disableIndexHints: true` to disable hinting to the DB to use `id` as index which can cause problems with DocumentDB.

## Common migration scripts

### Delete field from the database

With the MongoDB adapter, even if you delete a field from your Payload config, the existing field data will still be remained in the database.
If you want to ensure that the field is fully erased from the database, you can use the following script:

```ts
// pnpx payload migrate:create --name delete-field
export async function up({ payload, session }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {
  await payload.db.collections.posts.collection.updateMany(
    {},
    {
      $unset: {
        // delete title field
        title: true,
        // nested to array
        'array.title': true,
      },
    },
    { session },
  )
}
```

### Synchronize indexes

Payload won't automatically replace existing indexes in MongoDB when you change your Payload config.
For example, changing `index: true` to `unique: true` won't automatically update the index in MongoDB.
You can use the following script to synchronize indexes:

```ts
// pnpx payload migrate:create --name sync-posts-indexes
export async function up({ payload, session }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {
  await payload.db.collections.posts.syncIndexes()
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  Note that this will also drop all indexes that aren't in the payload config.
  If you have custom indexes that you want to keep, they must be added to the collection schema
  or you can insert them manually after `syncIndexes` with:
  `payload.db.collections.posts.collection.createIndex({ title: 1 })`
</Banner>

### Making field localized and vice versa

When you change a field to be localized or vice versa, you can use the following script to update the field in the database:

```ts
// pnpx payload migrate:create --name make-title-localized
export async function up({ payload, session }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {
  const posts = await payload.db.collections.posts.collection
    .find({}, { session })
    .toArray()

  // Make "title" localized
  await payload.db.collections.posts.collection.bulkWrite(
    posts.map((post) => ({
      updateOne: {
        filter: { _id: post._id },
        update: { $set: { title: { en: post.title } } },
      },
    })),
  )

  // Make "title" non-localized
  await payload.db.collections.posts.collection.bulkWrite(
    posts.map((post) => ({
      updateOne: {
        filter: { _id: post._id },
        update: { $set: { title: post.title.en } },
      },
    })),
  )
}
```

### Example renaming a collection

The following example renames a collection with slug "pages" to "articles" and it includes migrating the \_versions collection also.

```ts
import { MigrateDownArgs, MigrateUpArgs } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'
// import type { Db } from 'mongodb' // you will need to add this package as a devDependency in the package.json if you want db to be typed as Db

export async function up({
  payload,
  req,
  session,
}: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {
  const db = payload.db.connection.db as any

  await db.renameCollection('pages', 'articles', { session, dropTarget: true })
  await db.renameCollection('_pages_versions', '_articles_versions', {
    session,
    dropTarget: true,
  }) // remove this line if you do not have versions enabled
}

export async function down({
  payload,
  req,
  session,
}: MigrateDownArgs): Promise<void> {
  const db = payload.db.connection.db as any

  await db.renameCollection('articles', 'pages', { session, dropTarget: true })
  await db.renameCollection('_articles_versions', '_pages_versions', {
    session,
    dropTarget: true,
  }) // remove this line if you do not have versions enabled
}
```
