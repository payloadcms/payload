Payload exposes a full suite of migration controls available for your use. Migration commands are accessible via
the `npm run payload` command in your project directory.

Ensure you have an npm script called "payload" in your `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "payload": "cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload"
  }
}
```

  Note that you need to run Payload migrations through the package manager that you are using, because Payload should not be globally installed on your system.

### Migration file contents

Payload stores all created migrations in a folder that you can specify. By default, migrations are stored
in `./src/migrations`.

A migration file has two exports - an `up` function, which is called when a migration is executed, and a `down` function
that will be called if for some reason the migration fails to complete successfully. The `up` function should contain
all changes that you attempt to make within the migration, and the `down` should ideally revert any changes you make.

For an added level of safety, migrations should leverage Payload [transactions](/docs/database/transactions). Migration
functions should make use of the `req` by adding it to the arguments of your payload local API calls such
as `payload.create` and database adapter methods like `payload.db.create`.

Here is an example migration file:

```ts
import { MigrateUpArgs, MigrateDownArgs } from '@payloadcms/your-db-adapter'

export async function up ({ payload, req }: MigrateUpArgs): Promise<void> {
  // Perform changes to your database here.
  // You have access to `payload` as an argument, and
  // everything is done in TypeScript.
};

export async function down ({ payload, req }: MigrateDownArgs): Promise<void> {
  // Do whatever you need to revert changes if the `up` function fails
};
```

### Migrations Directory

Each DB adapter has an optional property `migrationDir` where you can override where you want your migrations to be
stored/read. If this is not specified, Payload will check the default and possibly make a best effort to find your
migrations directory by searching in common locations ie. `./src/migrations`, `./dist/migrations`, `./migrations`, etc.

All database adapters should implement similar migration patterns, but there will be small differences based on the
adapter and its specific needs. Below is a list of all migration commands that should be supported by your database
adapter.

## Commands

### Migrate

The `migrate` command will run any migrations that have not yet been run.

```text
npm run payload migrate
```

### Create

Create a new migration file in the migrations directory. You can optionally name the migration that will be created. By
default, migrations will be named using a timestamp.

```text
npm run payload migrate:create optional-name-here
```

### Status

The `migrate:status` command will check the status of migrations and output a table of which migrations have been run,
and which migrations have not yet run.

`payload migrate:status`

```text
npm run payload migrate:status
```

### Down

Roll back the last batch of migrations.

```text
npm run payload migrate:down
```

### Refresh

Roll back all migrations that have been run, and run them again.

```text
npm run payload migrate:refresh
```

### Reset

Roll back all migrations.

```text
npm run payload migrate:reset
```

### Fresh

Drops all entities from the database and re-runs all migrations from scratch.

```text
npm run payload migrate:fresh
```
