Database indexes are a way to optimize the performance of your database by allowing it to quickly locate and retrieve data. If you have a field that you frequently query or sort by, adding an index to that field can significantly improve the speed of those operations.

When your query runs, the database will not scan the entire document to find that one field, but will instead use the index to quickly locate the data.

To index a field, set the `index` option to `true` in your field's config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  fields: [
    // ...
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
      // highlight-start
      index: true,
      // highlight-end
    },
  ]
}
```

  **Tip:** If you're using MongoDB, you can use [MongoDB
  Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to visualize and manage
  your indexes.
