# Payload Live Preview Example Front-End

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). It was made explicitly for Payload's [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload).

> This example uses the App Router, the latest API of Next.js. If your app is using the legacy [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), check out the official [Pages Router Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/next-pages).

## Getting Started

### Payload

First you'll need a running Payload app. There is one made explicitly for this example and [can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload). If you have not done so already, clone it down and follow the setup instructions there. This will provide all the necessary APIs that your Next.js app requires for authentication.

### Next.js

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the server
5. `open http://localhost:3001` to see the result

Once running you will find a couple seeded pages on your local environment with some basic instructions. You can also start editing the pages by modifying the documents within Payload. See the [Live Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/live-preview/payload) for full details.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js. You could also combine this app into a [single Express server](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/custom-server) and deploy in to [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import).

Check out our [Payload deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) or the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
