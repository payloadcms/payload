# Payload Draft Preview Example

The [Payload Draft Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/draft-preview/payload) demonstrates how to implement draft preview in [Payload](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) using [Versions](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/overview) and [Drafts](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts). Draft preview allows you to see content on your front-end before it is published. There are various fully working front-ends made explicitly for this example, including:

- [Next.js App Router](../next-app)
- [Next.js Pages Router](../next-pages)

Follow the instructions in each respective README to get started. If you are setting up draft preview for another front-end, please consider contributing to this repo with your own example!

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables
4. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the server and seed the database
5. Open [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)  to access the admin panel
6. Login with email `demo@payloadcms.com` and password `demo`

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. See the [Development](#development) section for more details.

## How it works

Draft preview works by sending the user to your front-end with a `secret` along with their http-only cookies. Your front-end catches the request, verifies the authenticity, then enters into it's own preview mode. Once in preview mode, your front-end can begin securely requesting draft documents from Payload. See [Preview Mode](#preview-mode) for more details.

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend any of this functionality.

- #### Users

  The `users` collection is auth-enabled which provides access to the admin panel. When previewing documents on your front-end, the user's JWT is used to authenticate the request. See [Pages](#pages) for more details.

  For additional help with authentication, see the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs or the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth).

- #### Pages

  The `pages` collection is draft-enabled and has access control that restricts public users from viewing pages with a `_status` of `draft`. To fetch draft documents on your front-end, simply include the `draft=true` query param along with the `Authorization` header once you have entered [Preview Mode](#preview-mode).

  ```ts
    const preview = true; // set this based on your own front-end environment (see `Preview Mode` below)
    const pageSlug = 'example-page'; // same here
    const searchParams = `?where[slug][equals]=${pageSlug}&depth=1${preview ? `&draft=true` : ''}`

    // when previewing, send the payload token to bypass draft access control
    const pageReq = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL}/api/pages${searchParams}`, {
      headers: {
        ...preview ? {
          Authorization: `JWT ${payloadToken}`,
        } : {},
      },
    })
  ```

  For more details on how to extend this functionality, see the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication) docs.

### Preview Mode

To preview draft documents, the user first needs to have at least one draft document saved. When they click the "preview" button from the Payload admin panel, a custom [preview function](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections#preview) routes them to your front-end with a `secret` along with their http-only cookies. An API route on your front-end will verify the secret and token before entering into it's own preview mode. Once in preview mode, it can begin requesting drafts from Payload using the `Authorization` header. See [Pages](#pages) for more details.

> "Preview mode" looks differently for every front-end framework. For instance, check out the differences between Next.js [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) in the Pages Router and [Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode) in the App Router. In Next.js, methods are provided that set cookies in your browser, but this may not be the case for all frameworks.

### On-demand Revalidation

If your front-end is statically generated then you may also want to regenerate the HTML for each page individually as they are published, referred to as On-demand Revalidation. This will prevent your static site from having to fully rebuild every page in order to deploy content changes. To do this, we add an `afterChange` hook to the collection that fires a request to your front-end in the background each time the document is updated. You can handle this request on your front-end to revalidate the HTML for your page.

> On-demand revalidation looks differently for every front-end framework. For instance, check out the differences between Next.js on-demand revalidation in the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) and the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating#on-demand-revalidation). In Next.js, methods are provided that regenerate the HTML for each page, but this may not be the case for all frameworks.

### Admin Bar

You might also want to render an admin bar on your front-end so that logged-in users can quickly navigate between the front-end and Payload as they're editing. For React apps, check out the official [Payload Admin Bar](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload-admin-bar). For other frameworks, simply hit the `/me` route with `credentials: 'include'` and render your own admin bar if the user is logged in.

### CORS

The [`cors`](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/preventing-abuse#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors), [`csrf`](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/preventing-abuse#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf), and [`cookies`](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/config#options) settings are configured to ensure that the admin panel and front-end can communicate with each other securely. If you are combining your front-end and admin panel into a single application that runs of a shared port and domain, you can simplify your config by removing these settings.

For more details on this, see the [CORS](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/preventing-abuse#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors) docs.

## Development

To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start).

### Seed

On boot, a seed script is included to scaffold a basic database for you to use as an example. This is done by setting the `PAYLOAD_DROP_DATABASE` and `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SEED` environment variables which are included in the `.env.example` by default. You can remove these from your `.env` to prevent this behavior. You can also freshly seed your project at any time by running `yarn seed`. This seed creates a user with email `demo@payloadcms.com` and password `demo` along with a home page and an example page with two versions, one published and the other draft.

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.

## Production

To run Payload in production, you need to build and serve the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. First invoke the `payload build` script by running `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `./build` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Then run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `./build` directory.

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your project is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import), a one-click hosting solution to deploy production-ready instances of your Payload apps directly from your GitHub repo. You can also choose to self-host your app, check out the [Deployment](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) docs for more details.
