# Payload Payload + Remix Example

This example is built based on an old version of the website template.

The objective is to show to use the Local API with Remix framework.
This is achieved through monorepo with 2 apps:
[payload](./payload) - Next.js admin panel and definition of the Payload config.
[website](./payload) - Remix website, imports the payload config from [payload](./payload)

##Â Setup

1. `cp ./payload/.env.example ./payload./.env` (copy the payload .env.example file to .env)
2. `cp ./website/.env.example ./website/.env` (copy the website .env.example file to .env)
3. `pnpm install`
4. `pnpm run dev:payload`
5. `pnpm run dev:website` (in a separate terminal)
