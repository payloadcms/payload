We cannot recreate the issue with the provided information. **Please add a reproduction in order for us to be able to investigate.**

### Why was this issue marked with the `invalid-reproduction` label?

To be able to investigate, we need access to a reproduction to identify what triggered the issue. We prefer a link to a public GitHub repository created with `create-payload-app@beta -t blank` or a forked/branched version of this repository with tests added (more info in the [reproduction-guide](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/.github/reproduction-guide.md)).

To make sure the issue is resolved as quickly as possible, please make sure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. This means that you should **remove unnecessary code, files, and dependencies** that do not contribute to the issue. Ensure your reproduction does not depend on secrets, 3rd party registries, private dependencies, or any other data that cannot be made public. Avoid a reproduction including a whole monorepo (unless relevant to the issue). The easier it is to reproduce the issue, the quicker we can help.

Please test your reproduction against the latest version of Payload to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.

### I added a link, why was it still marked?

Ensure the link is pointing to a codebase that is accessible (e.g. not a private repository). "[example.com](http://example.com/)", "n/a", "will add later", etc. are not acceptable links -- we need to see a public codebase. See the above section for accepted links.
