### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES: @payloadcms/richtext-lexical

* **richtext-lexical:** Update lexical from 0.12.6 to 0.13.1, port over all useful changes from playground (#5066)

- You HAVE to make sure that any versions of the lexical packages (IF you have any installed) match the lexical version which richtext-lexical uses: v0.13.1. If you do not do this, you may be plagued by React useContext / "cannot find active editor state" errors
- Updates to lexical's API, e.g. the removal of INTERNAL_isPointSelection, could be breaking depending on your code. Please consult the [lexical changelog](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

#### @payloadcms/richtext-lexical

* **richtext-lexical:** rename TreeviewFeature into TreeViewFeature ([#4520](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/4520)) ([c49fd66](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/c49fd6692231b68ca61b079103a0fd7aa4673be1))

If you import TreeviewFeature, you have to rename the import to use TreeViewFeature (capitalized "V")

* **richtext-lexical:** link node: change doc data format to be consistent with relationship field ([#4504](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/4504)) ([cc0ba89](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/cc0ba895188f40181c6ba3779f66d547d4ea66f9))

An unpopulated, internal link node no longer saves the doc id under fields.doc.value.id. Now, it saves it under fields.doc.value.
Migration inside of payload is automatic. If you are reading from the link node inside of your frontend though, you will have to adjust it.

* **richtext-lexical:** improve floating select menu Dropdown classNames ([#4444](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/4444)) ([9331204](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/9331204295bfeaf7dd10bc075f42995b2cab2de4))

Dropdown component has a new mandatory sectionKey prop

* **richtext-lexical:** lazy import React components to prevent client-only code from leaking into the server ([#4290](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/4290)) ([5de347f](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/5de347ffffca3bf38315d3d87d2ccc5c28cd2723))

1. Most important: If you are updating `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` to v0.4.0 or higher, you will HAVE to update payload to the latest version as well. If you don't update it, payload likely won't start up due to validation errors. It's generally good practice to upgrade packages prefixed with @payloadcms/ together with payload and keep the versions in sync.

2. `@payloadcms/richtext-slate` is not affected by this.

3. Every single property in the `Feature` interface which accepts a React component now no longer accepts a React component, but a function which imports a React component instead. This is done to ensure no unnecessary client-only code is leaked to the server when importing Features on a server.
Here's an example migration:

Old:

```ts
import { BlockIcon } from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block'
...
Icon: BlockIcon,
```

New:

```ts
// import { BlockIcon } from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block' // <= Remove this import
...
Icon: () =>
  // @ts-expect-error
  import('../../lexical/ui/icons/Block').then((module) => module.BlockIcon),
```

Or alternatively, if you're using default exports instead of named exports:

```ts
// import BlockIcon from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block' // <= Remove this import
...
Icon: () =>
  // @ts-expect-error
  import('../../lexical/ui/icons/Block'),
```

4. The types for `SanitizedEditorConfig` and `EditorConfig` have changed. Their respective `lexical` property no longer expects the `LexicalEditorConfig`. It now expects a function returning the `LexicalEditorConfig`. You will have to adjust this if you adjusted that property anywhere, e.g. when initializing the lexical field editor property, or when initializing a new headless editor.

5. The following exports are now exported from the `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/components` subpath exports instead of `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`:

- `ToolbarButton`
- `ToolbarDropdown`
- `RichTextCell`
- `RichTextField`
- `defaultEditorLexicalConfig`

You will have to adjust your imports, only if you import any of those properties in your project.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **richtext-lexical:** lazy import React components to prevent client-only code from leaking into the server (#4290)

### ⚠️ @payloadcms/richtext-lexical

Most important: If you are updating `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` to v0.4.0 or higher, you will HAVE to update `payload` to the latest version as well. If you don't update it, payload likely won't start up due to validation errors. It's generally good practice to upgrade packages prefixed with `@payloadcms/` together with `payload` and keep the versions in sync.

`@payloadcms/richtext-slate` is not affected by this.

Every single property in the `Feature` interface which accepts a React component now no longer accepts a React component, but a function which imports a React component instead. This is done to ensure no unnecessary client-only code is leaked to the server when importing Features on a server.
Here's an example migration:

Old:

```ts
import { BlockIcon } from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block'
...
Icon: BlockIcon,
```

New:

```ts
// import { BlockIcon } from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block' // <= Remove this import
...
Icon: () =>
  // @ts-expect-error
  import('../../lexical/ui/icons/Block').then((module) => module.BlockIcon),
```

Or alternatively, if you're using default exports instead of named exports:

```ts
// import BlockIcon from '../../lexical/ui/icons/Block' // <= Remove this import
...
Icon: () =>
  // @ts-expect-error
  import('../../lexical/ui/icons/Block'),
```

The types for `SanitizedEditorConfig` and `EditorConfig` have changed. Their respective `lexical` property no longer expects the `LexicalEditorConfig`. It now expects a function returning the `LexicalEditorConfig`. You will have to adjust this if you adjusted that property anywhere, e.g. when initializing the lexical field editor property, or when initializing a new headless editor.

The following exports are now exported from the `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/components` subpath exports instead of `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`:

- ToolbarButton
- ToolbarDropdown
- RichTextCell
- RichTextField
- defaultEditorLexicalConfig

You will have to adjust your imports, only if you import any of those properties in your project.

### BREAKING CHANGES

### ⚠️ @payloadcms/richtext-lexical

The `SlashMenuGroup` and `SlashMenuOption` classes have changed. If you have any custom lexical Features which are adding new slash menu entries, this will be a breaking change for you. If not, no action is required from your side.

Here are the breaking changes and how to migrate:

1. The `SlashMenuOption`'s first argument is now used as a `key` and not as a display name. Additionally, a new, optional `displayName` property is added which will serve as the display name. Make sure your `key` does not contain any spaces or special characters.
2. The `title` property of `SlashMenuGroup` has been replaced by a new, mandatory `key` and an optional `displayName` property. To migrate, you will have to remove the `title` property and add a `key` property instead - make sure you do not use spaces or special characters in the `key`.
3. Additionally, if you have custom styles targeting elements inside of slash or floating-select-toolbar menus, you will have to adjust those too, as the CSS classes changed

### BREAKING CHANGES

### ⚠️ You now need to provide your Payload config with a database, a bundler, and a rich text adapter

Here's an example of a barebones Payload config, set up to work as 1.0 did:

```ts
import { mongooseAdapter } from "@payloadcms/db-mongodb";
import { slateEditor } from "@payloadcms/richtext-slate";
import { webpackBundler } from "@payloadcms/bundler-webpack";
import { buildConfig } from "payload/config";

export default buildConfig({
  admin: {
    bundler: webpackBundler(),
  },
  editor: slateEditor({}),
  collections: [
    // your collections here
  ],
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
});
```

These new properties are all now required for Payload to function, and you will have to install each separate adapter that you use. Feel free to swap out any of the adapters with your choice (Lexical, Postgres, Vite, etc.)

Make sure to install the packages that you need. In the above example, you would need to install the following:

```bash
npm install --save @payloadcms/db-mongodb @payloadcms/richtext-slate @payloadcms/bundler-webpack
```

### ⚠️ Draft versions now require a `latest: true` property to be set on the most recent draft in your `_versions` collections(s)

We have a ready-to-go migration script for your versions from v1 to v2, and to use it, all you have to do is run the following commands:

**1. First, make sure you have a `payload` npm script in your `package.json`**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "payload": "cross-env PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts payload"
  }
}
```

Adjust the `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH` to point to your Payload config file if necessary.

**2. Create a migration, using the new Payload migration API**

```bash
npm run payload migrate:create --file @payloadcms/db-mongodb/versions-v1-v2
```

The above command will output a migration file into your `./src/migrations` folder (default migrations location). It contains a migration script to automatically add a `latest: true` flag to each of your newest drafts, for all draft-enabled collections. It works out of the box!

**3. Run migrations**

From there, you need to run migrations. Run the following command to execute your new migration:

```bash
npm run payload migrate
```

And you'll be all good!

### ⚠️ Array and block field validations now accept the full array of field data as their validation argument instead of the value.length

This change should only affect you if you have a custom array / block validation defined.

### ⚠️ For MongoDB, all models have been moved from the Payload object to the database adapter

For example, if you are leveraging Mongoose models directly, in 1.0, you would have accessed them via `payload.collections[myCollectionSlug].Model`. Now, you can access the Mongoose model from `payload.db.collections[myCollectionSlug]`.

Version models can be accessed from `payload.db.versions[myEntitySlug]`, and the global model can be accessed via `payload.db.globals`.

### ⚠️ User preferences data shape has changed, and you will lose preferences unless you manually migrate them to the new shape

We don't have a migration ready to go yet for user preferences, and this typically wouldn't be a big deal for most Payload projects. So don't let it stop you from updating unless you have a serious amount of user preferences that you'd like to keep. If so, we'll come up with a migration script for you and hook you up. Just reach out to us on Discord to ask for this.

### ⚠️ Node 16 is now the minimum required node version and Node 14 is no longer supported

Pretty self-explanatory on this one. Node 14 is old.

### ⚠️ The Pino logger has been updated, which may require you to make changes to your Pino config if you have a custom one

If you don't have anything custom with the Pino logger, this does not apply to you.

### ⚠️ Transactions are now enabled by default if your database supports them

MongoDB requires a replica set for transactions to work, so they likely are not going to work for you unless you do indeed have a replica set configured. But if you do, transactions will now instantly work for all internal Payload operations.

This means that in some fringe cases, if you are creating a doc and then instantly trying to update it within an `afterChange` hook, the newly created doc may not truly exist yet. This should not cause any problems for 99% of projects, but if you think this applies to you, might be good to double-check through your code.

To avoid any issues, you can pass the `req.transactionID` through to your Local API calls, so that your Local API calls are included as part of the parent transaction.

### ⚠️ Locales now have more functionality, and in some places, you might need to update custom code

Payload's locales have become more powerful and now allow you to customize more aspects per locale such as a human-friendly label and if the locale is RTL or not.

This means that certain functions now return a different shape, such as `useLocale`. This hook used to return a string of the locale code you are currently editing, but it now returns an object with type of `Locale`.

### ⚠️ Admin panel CSS classes may have changed

The revisions we've made in 2.0 required changes to both HTML and CSS within the admin panel. For this reason, if you were loading custom CSS into the admin panel to customize the look and feel, your stylesheets may need to be updated. If your CSS is targeting elements on the page using HTML selectors or class names, you may need to update these selectors based on the current markup. It may also be necessary to update your style definitions if the core Payload component you are targeting has undergone significant change.

In many cases, our classnames and structure have remained the same, but technically, this could be a breaking change.

### ⚠️ Custom admin views API has changed

These changes only affect apps that are using custom views via the `admin.components.routes` config.

The type `AdminRoute` was renamed to `AdminViewConfig`. Simply update your instances with this new type and it will continue to work as expected. The properties of this type have not changed.

The `admin.components.routes` config has been merged with `admin.components.views`. Simply move your custom views to the `views` object. The properties of the config have not changed. Here is an example:

Previous:

```ts
admin: {
  components: {
    routes: [
      {
        Component: MyCustomView,
        path: "/custom-view",
      },
    ];
  }
}
```

Current:

```ts
admin: {
  components: {
    views: {
      MyCustomView: {
        Component: MyCustomView,
        path: '/custom-view'
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Rich text admin properties have moved

If you have customized the Slate rich text editor via `admin.elements` or `admin.leaves` properties, you now need to add your customizations to a `slateEditor({ admin: {} })` property. The signatures are all the same, but you might have to move some properties around.

Previous:

```ts
const myRichTextField: Field = {
  name: "content",
  type: "richText",
  admin: {
    elements: [
      "h1",
      "link",
      // etc
    ],
  },
};
```

Current:

```ts
import { slateEditor } from "@payloadcms/richtext-slate";

const myRichTextField: Field = {
  name: "content",
  type: "richText",
  editor: slateEditor({
    // Move the admin property as shown below
    admin: {
      elements: [
        "h1",
        "link",
        // etc
      ],
    },
  }),
};
```

### ⚠️ MongoDB connection options have been removed from `payload.init`

To pass connection options for MongoDB, you now need to pass them to `db: mongooseAdapter({})` instead of passing them to `payload.init()`.

### ⚠️ Some types have changed locations

If you are importing types from Payload, some of their locations may have changed. An example would be Slate-specific types being no longer exported from Payload itself—they are now exported from the `@payloadcms/richtext-slate` package.

### Recap

That's it! Most of these changes will be instantly apparent to you thanks to TypeScript, and many may not apply to you at all. But this list should be comprehensive and we will do our best to keep everything up-to-date here accordingly. There are inevitably some types that have changed locations, and similar things like that, but overall, you should be able to swing the breaking changes and get updated.

If you need a hand, reach out on Discord and we will hook you up!

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

#### ✋ Payload now no longer transpiles your config for you

This release removes the need to use `@swc/register` to automatically transpile Payload configs, which dramatically improves Payload initialization speeds and simplifies the core Payload logic significantly. More info in the PR [here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/pull/1847).

If you are not using TypeScript, this will be a breaking change. There are many ways to mitigate this - but the best way is to just quickly scaffold a barebones TS implementation. You can still write JavaScript, and this PR does not require you to write TS, but handling transpilation with TypeScript will be an easy way forward and can set you up to opt-in to TS over time as well.

For instructions regarding how to migrate to TS, [review the PR here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/pull/1847).

#### ✋ Payload `init` is now always async, and `payload.initAsync` has been removed

We are pulling off a bandaid here and enforcing that `payload.init` is now asynchronous across the board. This will help prevent issues in the future and allow us to do more advanced things within `init` down the road. But this will be a breaking change if your project uses `payload.init` right now.

To migrate, you need to convert your code everywhere that you run `payload.init` to be asynchronous instead. For example, here is an example of a traditional `payload.init` call which needs to be migrated:

```js
const express = require('express')
const payload = require('payload')

const app = express()

payload.init({
  secret: 'SECRET_KEY',
  mongoURL: 'mongodb://localhost/payload',
  express: app,
})

app.listen(3000, async () => {
  console.log('Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.')
})
```

Your `payload.init` call will need to be converted into the following:

```js
const express = require('express')
const payload = require('payload')

const app = express()

const start = async () => {
  await payload.init({
    secret: 'SECRET_KEY',
    mongoURL: 'mongodb://localhost/payload',
    express: app,
  })

  app.listen(3000, async () => {
    console.log('Express is now listening for incoming connections on port 3000.')
  })
}

start()
```

Notice that all we've done is wrapped the `payload.init` and `app.listen` calls with a `start` function that is asynchronous.

#### ✋ All Local API methods are no longer typed as generics, and instead will infer types for you automatically

Before this release, the Local API methods were configured as generics. For example, here is an example of the `findByID` method prior to this release:

```ts
const post = await payload.findByID<Post>({
  collection: 'posts',
  id: 'id-of-post-here',
})
```

Now, you don't need to pass your types and Payload will automatically infer them for you, as well as significantly improve typing throughout the local API. Here's an example:

```ts
const post = await payload.findByID({
  collection: 'posts', // this is now auto-typed
  id: 'id-of-post-here',
})

// `post` will be automatically typed as `Post`
```

To migrate, just remove the generic implementation!

But there's one more thing to do before Payload can automatically type your Local API. You need to add a path to your `tsconfig.json` file that matches your exported types from Payload:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // your compilerOptions here
    "paths": {
      // Tell TS where to find your generated types
      // This is the default location below
      "payload/generated-types": ["./src/payload-types.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then go regenerate your types. We've extended the `payload generate:types` method a bit to be more complete. Upon regenerating types, you'll see a new `Config` export at the top of the file which contains a key - value pair of all your collection and global types, which Payload will automatically import.

#### ✋ JSX support must be defined in `tsconfig.json`

If not already defined, add the following to your `compilerOptions`:

```ts
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react"
  }
```

#### ✋ Versions may need to be migrated

This release includes a substantial simplification / optimization of how Versions work within Payload. They are now significantly more performant and easier to understand behind-the-scenes. We've removed ~600 lines of code and have ensured that Payload can be compatible with all flavors of MongoDB - including versions earlier than 4.0, Azure Cosmos MongoDB, AWS' DocumentDB and more.

But, some of your draft-enabled documents may need to be migrated.

If you are using versions and drafts on any collections, you can run a simple migration script to ensure that your drafts appear correctly in the Admin UI. Your data will never disappear from your database in any case if you update, but some drafts may not show in the List view anymore.

To migrate, create this file within the root of your Payload project:

**migrateVersions.ts**

```ts
const payload = require('payload')

require('dotenv').config()

const { PAYLOAD_SECRET, MONGODB_URI } = process.env

// This function ensures that there is at least one corresponding version for any document
// within each of your draft-enabled collections.

const ensureAtLeastOneVersion = async () => {
  // Initialize Payload
  // IMPORTANT: make sure your ENV variables are filled properly here
  // as the below variable names are just for reference.
  await payload.init({
    secret: PAYLOAD_SECRET,
    mongoURL: MONGODB_URI,
    local: true,
  })

  // For each collection
  await Promise.all(
    payload.config.collections.map(async ({ slug, versions }) => {
      // If drafts are enabled
      if (versions?.drafts) {
        const { docs } = await payload.find({
          collection: slug,
          limit: 0,
          depth: 0,
          locale: 'all',
        })

        const VersionsModel = payload.versions[slug]
        const existingCollectionDocIds: Array<string> = []
        await Promise.all(
          docs.map(async (doc) => {
            existingCollectionDocIds.push(doc.id)
            // Find at least one version for the doc
            const versionDocs = await VersionsModel.find(
              {
                parent: doc.id,
                updatedAt: { $gte: doc.updatedAt },
              },
              null,
              { limit: 1 },
            ).lean()

            // If there are no corresponding versions,
            // we need to create one
            if (versionDocs.length === 0) {
              try {
                await VersionsModel.create({
                  parent: doc.id,
                  version: doc,
                  autosave: Boolean(versions?.drafts?.autosave),
                  updatedAt: doc.updatedAt,
                  createdAt: doc.createdAt,
                })
              } catch (e) {
                console.error(
                  `Unable to create version corresponding with collection ${slug} document ID ${doc.id}`,
                  e?.errors || e,
                )
              }

              console.log(`Created version corresponding with ${slug} document ID ${doc.id}`)
            }
          }),
        )

        const versionsWithoutParentDocs = await VersionsModel.deleteMany({
          parent: { $nin: existingCollectionDocIds },
        })

        if (versionsWithoutParentDocs.deletedCount > 0) {
          console.log(
            `Removing ${versionsWithoutParentDocs.deletedCount} versions for ${slug} collection - parent documents no longer exist`,
          )
        }
      }
    }),
  )

  console.log('Done!')
  process.exit(0)
}

ensureAtLeastOneVersion()
```

Make sure your environment variables match the script's values above and then run `PAYLOAD_CONFIG_PATH=src/payload.config.ts npx ts-node -T migrateVersions.ts` in your terminal. Make sure that you point the command to your Payload config.

This migration script will ensure that there is at least one corresponding version for each of your draft-enabled documents. It will also delete any versions that no longer have parent documents.

### 👀 Example of a properly migrated project

For an example of how everything works with this update, go ahead and run `npx create-payload-app`. We've updated `create-payload-app` to reflect all the necessary changes here and you can use a new project to compare / contrast what you have in your current project with what Payload needs now in this release.

- feat!: no longer sanitize collection slugs to kebab case (#1607) ([ba2f2d6](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/ba2f2d6e9b66568b11632bacdd92cfdc8ddae300)), closes [#1607](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/1607)

### Features

- add Norwegian bokmål (nb) translation ([#1614](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/1614)) ([759f001](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/759f00168137ff1a0fd862796a5971a9ba0264cd))

- upload support pasting file ([eb69b82](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/eb69b82adfb4e94c1ef36b219310c55afc7a1d4e))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- collection slugs are no longer automatically sanitized to be kebab case. This will only be an issue if your current slugs were in camel case. The upgrade path will be to change those slugs to the kebab case version that the slug was automatically being sanitized to on the backend.

If you only use kebab case or single word slugs: no action needed.

If you have existing slugs with camel case and populated data: you'll need to convert these to the kebab case version to match the previously sanitized value.

ie. myOldSlug is your slug, you should convert it to my-old-slug.

Any future slugs after updating will be used as-is.

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

- You **_might_** need to update your config. This change affects `collections`, `globals` and `block fields` with custom labeling.

  - **Collections:** are affected if you have a custom `labels.singular` defined that differs from your collection slug.

    ```typescript
    // ExampleCollection.ts

    // Before
    const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
      slug: 'case-studies',
      labels: {
        // Before Payload used `labels.singular` to generate types/graphQL schema
        singular: 'Project',
        plural: 'Projects',
      },
    }

    // After
    const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
      // Now Payload uses `slug` to generate types/graphQL schema
      slug: 'case-studies',
      labels: {
        singular: 'Project',
        plural: 'Projects',
      },
      // To override the usage of slug in graphQL schema generation
      graphQL: {
        singularName: 'Project',
        pluralName: 'Projects',
      },
      // To override the usage of slug in type file generation
      typescript: {
        interface: 'Project',
      },
    }
    ```

  - **Globals:** are affected if you have a `label` defined that differs from your global slug.

    ```typescript
    // ExampleGlobal.ts

    // Before
    const ExampleGlobal: GlobalConfig = {
      slug: 'footer',
      // Before Payload used `label` to generate types/graphQL schema
      label: 'Page Footer',
    }

    // After
    const ExampleGlobal: GlobalConfig = {
      // Now Payload uses `slug` to generate types/graphQL schema
      slug: 'footer',
      label: 'Page Footer',
      // To override the usage of slug in graphQL schema generation
      graphQL: {
        name: 'PageFooter',
      },
      // To override the usage of slug in type file generation
      typescript: {
        interface: 'PageFooter',
      },
    }
    ```

  - **Block Fields:** are affected if you have a `label` defined that differs from your block slug.

    ````typescript
    // ExampleBlock.ts

        // Before
        const ExampleBlock: Block = {
          slug: 'content',
          // Before Payload used `label` to generate graphQL schema
          label: 'Content Block',
        }

        // After
        const ExampleBlock: Block = {
          // Now Payload uses `slug` to generate graphQL schema
          slug: 'content',
          label: 'Content Block',
          // To override the usage of slug in graphQL schema generation
          graphQL: {
            singularName: 'ContentBlock',
          },
        }
        ```

    **Breaking changes recap**:
    ````

* On Collections

  - Use `graphQL.singularName`, `graphQL.pluralName` for GraphQL schema names.
  - Use `typescript.interface` for typescript generation name.

* On Globals

  - Use `graphQL.name` for GraphQL Schema name.
  - Use `typescript.interface` for typescript generation name.

* On Blocks (within Block fields)
  - Use `graphQL.singularName` for graphQL schema names.

- allow clear select value ([#735](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/735)) ([3132d35](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/3132d35e27f3c1037aeb3d1801e13df2e992e98b))

### BREAKING CHANGES

We have removed our reliance on SCSS variables like color and font, replacing them instead with CSS variables wherever possible.

Due to this change, the `admin.scss` functionality has become obsolete, and overriding SCSS variables is not longer needed or supported. If you want to customize CSS, you can still do so, but via the `admin.css` property instead.

# [0.15.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0) (2022-03-16)

### BREAKING CHANGES

The GraphQL error response data object has moved from the top level to the extensions object.

Here is a previous example:

```js
{
 "message": "The following fields are invalid: location,",
 "data": [
  {
   "message": "This field requires two numbers",
   "field": "location"
  },
 ]
},
```

The new shape of GraphQL errors is as follows:

```js
"extensions": {
 "name": "ValidationError",
 "data": [
  {
   "message": "This field requires two numbers",
   "field": "location"
  },
 ]
}
```

# [0.9.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0) (2021-08-02)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Due to greater plugin possibilities and performance enhancements, plugins themselves no longer accept a completely sanitized config. Instead, they accept a _validated_ config as-provided, but sanitization is now only performed after all plugins have been initialized. By config santitization, we refer to merging in default values and ensuring that the config has its full, required shape. What this now means for plugins is that within plugin code, deeply nested properties like `config.graphQL.mutations` will need to be accessed safely (optional chaining is great for this), because a user's config may not have defined `config.graphQL`. So, the only real breaking change here is are that plugins now need to safely access properties from an incoming config.

### Features

- removes sanitization of configs before plugins are instantiated ([8af3947](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/8af39472e19a26453647d1c1ab0bbce15db2c642))

## [0.8.2](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2) (2021-08-02)

### Features

- export error types ([12cba62](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/12cba62930b8d35b22e3a7a99cf06df29bd4964a))

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2021-07-29)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- If you have any plugins that are written in TypeScript, we have changed plugin types to make them more flexible. Whereas before you needed to take in a fully sanitized config, and return a fully sanitized config, we now have simplified that requirement so that you can write configs in your own plugins just as an end user of Payload can write their own configs.

Now, configs will be sanitized **_before_** plugins are executed **_as well as_** after plugins are executed.

So, where your plugin may have been typed like this before:

```ts
import { SanitizedConfig } from 'payload/config'

const plugin = (config: SanitizedConfig): SanitizedConfig => {
  return {
    ...config,
  }
}
```

It can now be written like this:

```ts
import { Config } from 'payload/config'

const plugin = (config: Config): Config => {
  return {
    ...config,
  }
}
```

### Features

- improves plugin writability ([a002b71](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/commit/a002b7105f5c312e846c80032a350046db10236c))

# [0.8.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.7.10...v0.8.0) (2021-07-28)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- There have been a few very minor, yet breaking TypeScript changes in this release. If you are accessing Payload config types from directly within the `dist` folder, like any of the following:

- `import { PayloadCollectionConfig, CollectionConfig } from 'payload/dist/collections/config/types';`
- `import { PayloadGlobalConfig, GlobalConfig } from 'payload/dist/globals/config/types';`
- `import { Config, PayloadConfig } from 'payload/config';`

You may need to modify your code to work with this release. The TL;DR of the change is that we have improved our naming conventions of internally used types, which will become more important over time. Now, we have landed on a naming convention as follows:

- Incoming configs, typed correctly for optional / required config properties, are named `Config`, `CollectionConfig`, and `GlobalConfig`.
- Fully defaulted, sanitized, and validated configs are now named `SanitizedConfig`, `SanitizedCollectionConfig`, and `SanitizedGlobalConfig`.

They can be imported safely outside of the `dist` folder now as well. For more information on how to properly import which types you need, see the following Docs pages which have now been updated with examples on how to properly access the new types:

- [Base Payload config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview)
- [Collection config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections)
- [Global config docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals)

### Features

# [0.6.0](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/compare/v0.5.10...v0.6.0) (2021-04-19)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- By default, all Collection and Global access control functions are now set to require a user to be logged in to interact through GraphQL or REST APIs. This default access control is set to ensure that your API data is secure out of the box. From there, you can opt to publicly expose API actions as you need.

#### Migration Instructions to `0.6.x`

If you have any Collections or Globals that should be publicly available without being logged in, you need to define an access control function for each operation that needs to be publicly available.

For example, if you have a `pages` collection with no existing access control, and it should be publicly readable, you should change its config from this:

```js
const Page = {
  slug: 'pages',
  access: {
    // No `read` access control was set
  },
}
```

To:

```js
const Page = {
  slug: 'pages',
  access: {
    // Now we explicitly allow public read access
    // to this collection's documents
    read: () => true,
  },
}
```

If none of your collections or globals should be publicly exposed, you don't need to do anything to upgrade.
