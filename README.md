### Code-first

If you know JavaScript, you know Payload. Payload is a _code-first_ CMS, which allows us to do a lot of things right:

- Payload gives you everything you need, but then steps back and lets you build what you want in JavaScript or TypeScript - with no unnecessary complexity brought by GUIs. You'll understand how your CMS works, because you will have written it exactly how you want it.
- Bring your own Express server and do whatever you need on top of Payload. Payload doesn't impose anything on you or your app.
- Completely control the Admin panel by using your own React components. Swap out fields or even entire views with ease.
- Use your data however and wherever you need thanks to auto-generated, yet fully extensible REST, GraphQL and Local Node APIs.

### Free forever for personal use and small projects

Payload is 100% free for personal projects or small use cases where only one admin user is required. You can also get started without an account whatsoever while running on `localhost`.

## Installation

Before beginning to work with Payload, make sure you have all of the [required software](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

From there, the easiest way to get started with Payload is to use the `create-payload-app` package:

```
npx create-payload-app
```

Alternatively, it only takes about five minutes to [write out your own app from scratch](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation#from-scratch).
