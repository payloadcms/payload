Payload is the first-ever Next.js native CMS that can install directly in your existing `/app` folder. It's the start of a new era for headless CMS.

<h3>Benefits over a regular CMS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Deploy anywhere, including serverless on Vercel for free</li>
  <li>Combine your front+backend in the same <code>/app</code> folder if you want</li>
  <li>Don't sign up for yet another SaaS - Payload is open source</li>
  <li>Query your database in React Server Components</li>
  <li>Both admin and backend are 100% extensible</li>
  <li>No vendor lock-in</li>
  <li>Never touch ancient WP code again</li>
  <li>Build faster, never hit a roadblock</li>
</ul>

## Quickstart

Before beginning to work with Payload, make sure you have all of the [required software](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

```text
pnpx create-payload-app@latest
```

**If you're new to Payload, you should start with the website template** (`pnpx create-payload-app@latest -t website`). It shows how to do _everything_ - including custom Rich Text blocks, on-demand revalidation, live preview, and more. It comes with a frontend built with Tailwind all in one `/app` folder.

## One-click templates

Jumpstart your next project by starting with a pre-made template. These are production-ready, end-to-end solutions designed to get you to market as fast as possible.

### [üåê Website](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website)

Build any kind of website, blog, or portfolio from small to enterprise. Comes with a fully functional front-end built with RSCs and Tailwind.

We're constantly adding more templates to our [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates). If you maintain your own template, consider adding the `payload-template` topic to your GitHub repository for others to find.

- [Official Templates](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates)

## üìö Examples

The [Examples Directory](./examples) is a great resource for learning how to setup Payload in a variety of different ways, but you can also find great examples in our blog and throughout our social media.

If you'd like to run the examples, you can either copy them to a folder outside this repo or run them directly by (1) navigating to the example's subfolder (`cd examples/your-example-folder`) and (2) using the `--ignore-workspace` flag to bypass workspace restrictions (e.g., `pnpm --ignore-workspace install` or `pnpm --ignore-workspace dev`).

You can see more examples at:

- [Payload YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@payloadcms)

Payload is highly extensible and allows you to install or distribute plugins that add or remove functionality. There are both officially-supported and community-supported plugins available. If you maintain your own plugin, consider adding the `payload-plugin` topic to your GitHub repository for others to find.
