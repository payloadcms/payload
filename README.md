<h2>Benefits over a regular CMS</h2>
<h3>With Payload, the possibilities are endless. Rather than hitting someone else's API you hit yours. Which means you can avoid vendor lock-in, use your own database, and truly own your data. With an extremely extensible Admin UI + backend you can build faster, and never hit a roadblock. You'll avoid microservices hell, and never touch ancient WP code ever again.</h3>

## ⭐ Why Payload?

Payload is a CMS that has been designed for developers from the ground up to deliver them what they need to build great digital products. If you know JavaScript, you know Payload. It's a _code-first_ CMS, which allows us to do a lot of things right:

- Payload gives you everything you need, but then steps back and lets you build what you want in JavaScript or TypeScript - with no unnecessary complexity brought by GUIs. You'll understand how your CMS works because you will have written it exactly how you want it.
- Bring your own Express server and do whatever you need on top of Payload. Payload doesn't impose anything on you or your app.
- Completely control the Admin panel by using your own React components. Swap out fields or even entire views with ease.
- Use your data however and wherever you need thanks to auto-generated, yet fully extensible REST, GraphQL, and Local Node APIs.
