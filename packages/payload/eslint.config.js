/**
 * We've removed all eslint.config.js from the packages, but we have to leave this one as an exception.
 * The payload package is so large that without its own eslint.config, an M3 Pro (18GB) runs out of 
 * memory when linting. Interestingly, two days ago when I started this PR, this didn't happen, but it
 * started happening when I did a merge from main to update the PR.
 * tsc also takes a long time to run. It's likely that at some point we'll need to split the package 
 * (into payload1, payload2, etc.) and re-export them in payload.
