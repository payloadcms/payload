     *  - If a collection has all of its capabilities enabled, admins can allow or disallow the create, update, delete, and find capabilities on that collection.
     *  - If a collection only has the find capability enabled, admins can only allow or disallow the find capability on that collection.
     *  - If a custom tool has gone haywire, admins can disallow that tool.
