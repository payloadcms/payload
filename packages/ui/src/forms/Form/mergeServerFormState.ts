 * Doing this would cause the client to lose any local changes to those fields.
 *
 * Note: Local state is the source of truth, not the new server state that is getting merged in. This is critical for array row
 * manipulation specifically, where the user may have added, removed, or reordered rows while a request was pending and is now stale.
 *
 * This function applies some defaults, as well as cleans up the server response in preparation for the client.
 * e.g. it will set `valid` and `passesCondition` to true if undefined, and remove `addedByServer` from the response.
