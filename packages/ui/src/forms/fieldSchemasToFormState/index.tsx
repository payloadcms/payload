   * In some cases however, this function is used to generate form state solely for sub fields - independent from the parent form state.
   * This means that `data` will be the form state of the sub fields - the document data won't be available here.
   *
   * In these cases, you can pass `documentData` which will be used as `fullData` instead of `data`.
