## What's Included

The `payload` skill provides expert guidance on:

- **Collections**: Auth, uploads, drafts, live preview configurations
- **Fields**: All field types including relationships, arrays, blocks, joins, virtual fields
- **Hooks**: beforeChange, afterChange, beforeValidate, field hooks
- **Access Control**: Collection, field, and global access patterns including RBAC and multi-tenant

Once installed, Claude will automatically invoke the skill when you're working on Payload CMS projects. The skill activates when you:

You can also explicitly invoke it:

```
